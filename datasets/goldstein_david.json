To define the phenotype associated with a novel inherited disorder of cytosolic endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway dysfunction, we studied a series of eight patients with deficiency of N-glycanase 1. METHODS: Whole-genome, whole-exome, or standard Sanger sequencing techniques were employed. Retrospective chart reviews were performed in order to obtain clinical data. RESULTS: All patients had global developmental delay, a movement disorder, and hypotonia. Other common findings included hypolacrima or alacrima (7/8), elevated liver transaminases (6/7), microcephaly (6/8), diminished reflexes (6/8), hepatocyte cytoplasmic storage material or vacuolization (5/6), and seizures (4/8). The nonsense mutation c.1201A>T (p.R401X) was the most common deleterious allele. CONCLUSION: NGLY1 deficiency is a novel autosomal recessive disorder of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway associated with neurological dysfunction, abnormal tear production, and liver disease. The majority of patients detected to date carry a specific nonsense mutation that appears to be associated with severe disease. The phenotypic spectrum is likely to enlarge as cases with a broader range of mutations are detected.Genet Med 16 10, 751-758.","pmid":"24651605","apaCitation":"Enns, GM, Shashi, V, Bainbridge, M, Gambello, MJ, Zahir, FR, Bast, T, Crimian, R, Schoch, K, Platt, J, Cox, R, Bernstein, JA, Scavina, M, Walter, RS, Bibb, A, Jones, M, Hegde, M, Graham, BH, Need, AC, Oviedo, A, Schaaf, CP, Boyle, S, Butte, AJ, Chen, R, Clark, MJ, Haraksingh, R, Cowan, TM, He, P, Langlois, S, Zoghbi, HY, Snyder, M, Gibbs, RA, Freeze, HH, & Goldstein, DB.

To address the low power implicit in single-locus tests of rare genetic variants, many rare-variant association approaches attempt to accumulate information across a gene, often by taking linear combinations of single-locus contributions to a statistic. Using the right linear combination is key - an optimal test will up-weight true causal variants, down-weight neutral variants, and correctly assign the direction of effect for causal variants. Here, we propose a procedure that exploits data from population controls to estimate the linear combination to be used in an case-parent trio rare-variant association test. Specifically, we estimate the linear combination by comparing population control allele frequencies with allele frequencies in the parents of affected offspring. These estimates are then used to construct a rare-variant transmission disequilibrium test (rvTDT) in the case-parent data. Because the rvTDT is conditional on the parents' data, using parental data in estimating the linear combination does not affect the validity or asymptotic distribution of the rvTDT. By using simulation, we show that our new population-control-based rvTDT can dramatically improve power over rvTDTs that do not use population control information across a wide variety of genetic architectures. It also remains valid under population stratification. We apply the approach to a cohort of epileptic encephalopathy (EE) trios and find that dominant (or additive) inherited rare variants are unlikely to play a substantial role within EE genes previously identified through de novo mutation studies.

Randomized controlled studies to guide treatment choices, especially beyond first-line drugs, are not available. This report summarizes the evidence that guides the management of refractory convulsive SE (RCSE) in children, defines gaps in our clinical knowledge and describes the development and works of the 'pediatric Status Epilepticus Research Group' (pSERG). Methods A literature review was performed to evaluate current gaps in the pediatric SE and RCSE literature. In person and online meetings helped to develop and expand the pSERG network. Results The care of pediatric RCSE is largely based on extrapolations of limited evidence derived from adult literature and supplemented with case reports and case series in children. No comparative effectiveness trials have been performed in the pediatric population. Gaps in knowledge include risk factors for SE, biomarkers of SE and RCSE, second- and third-line treatment options, and long-term outcome. Conclusion The care of children with RCSE is based on limited evidence. In order to address these knowledge gaps, the multicenter pSERG was established to facilitate prospective collection, analysis, and sharing of de-identified data and biological specimens from children with RCSE.

These data are critically needed to develop clinically and economically grounded diagnostic algorithms that consider presenting phenotype, traditional genetics testing, and the emerging role of next-generation sequencing (whole-exome/genome sequencing). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 500 unselected consecutive patients who received traditional genetic diagnostic evaluations at a tertiary medical center. We calculated the diagnosis rate, number of visits to diagnosis, genetic tests, and the cost of testing. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were determined to not have a genetic disorder; 212 of the remaining 461 (46%) received a genetic diagnosis, and 72% of these were diagnosed on the first visit. The cost per subsequent successful genetic diagnosis was estimated at $25,000. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the patients were diagnosed using the traditional approach, most at the initial visit. For those remaining undiagnosed, next-generation sequencing may be clinically and economically beneficial. Estimating a 50% success rate for next-generation sequencing in undiagnosed genetic disorders, its application after the first clinical visit could result in a higher rate of genetic diagnosis at a considerable cost savings per successful diagnosis.","pmid":"23928913","apaCitation":"Shashi, V, McConkie-Rosell, A, Rosell, B, Schoch, K, Vellore, K, McDonald, M, Jiang, YH, Xie, P, Need, A, Goldstein, DB, & Goldstein, DG.

We show that recessive mutations in the ASNS gene are responsible for this syndrome. Two of the identified missense mutations dramatically reduce ASNS protein abundance, suggesting that the mutations cause loss of function. Hypomorphic Asns mutant mice have structural brain abnormalities, including enlarged ventricles and reduced cortical thickness, and show deficits in learning and memory mimicking aspects of the patient phenotype. ASNS encodes asparagine synthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine from glutamine and aspartate. The neurological impairment resulting from ASNS deficiency may be explained by asparagine depletion in the brain or by accumulation of aspartate/glutamate leading to enhanced excitability and neuronal damage. Our study thus indicates that asparagine synthesis is essential for the development and function of the brain but not for that of other organs.","pmid":"24139043","apaCitation":"Ruzzo, EK, Capo-Chichi, JM, Ben-Zeev, B, Chitayat, D, Mao, H, Pappas, AL, Hitomi, Y, Lu, YF, Yao, X, Hamdan, FF, Pelak, K, Reznik-Wolf, H, Bar-Joseph, I, Oz-Levi, D, Lev, D, Lerman-Sagie, T, Leshinsky-Silver, E, Anikster, Y, Ben-Asher, E, Olender, T, Colleaux, L, DÃ©carie, JC, Blaser, S, Banwell, B, Joshi, RB, He, XP, Patry, L, Silver, RJ, Dobrzeniecka, S, Islam, MS, Hasnat, A, Samuels, ME, Aryal, DK, Rodriguiz, RM, Jiang, YH, Wetsel, WC, McNamara, JO, Rouleau, GA, Silver, DL, Lancet, D, Pras, E, Mitchell, GA, Michaud, JL, & Goldstein, DB.

Here we report a screen for de novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations in the â¼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9âÃâ10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1âÃâ10(-10) and P = 7.8âÃâ10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L.

There have been many clear successes in identifying genes that are responsible for Mendelian diseases, and sequencing approaches are now poised to identify the mutations that cause undiagnosed childhood genetic diseases and those that predispose individuals to more common complex diseases. There are, however, growing concerns that the complexity and magnitude of complete sequence data could lead to an explosion of weakly justified claims of association between genetic variants and disease.

However, the recurrence of a hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after transplantation is universal and is associated with worse outcomes. Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH) is a particularly severe manifestation of a recurrent HCV infection and frequently results in graft failure and death. The identification of risk factors for FCH is important but has been limited by the low frequency of FCH. The interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype is important in an HCV infection: it is related to the clinical severity of an acute infection and may play a role in the development of FCH as well. Two hundred seventy-two consecutive LT cases for CHC were studied at a single institution. Consensus criteria were used to define an FCH cohort. The remainder of the study population served as a control group. The IL-28B genotype (at the rs12979860 locus) from both the donor and the recipient was determined, and other clinically relevant data were tabulated. A nonparametric statistical analysis was performed. Twelve cases of FCH were identified, and they were compared to a control group of 260 LT cases without FCH. A detailed analysis of clinical characteristics, including treatment responses and outcomes, was tabulated. FCH was associated with the earlier recurrence of HCV infections, higher HCV viral loads, and lower levels of immunosuppressive medications. There was a nonsignificant increase in recipient IL-28B non-CC genotypes in cases developing FCH. In conclusion, a high HCV viral load and earlier recurrence were identified as risk factors for FCH. It is still unclear what role immunosuppression plays in the pathogenesis of FCH and whether IL-28B polymorphisms constitute a risk factor. Collaborative studies with larger numbers of study subjects are needed in order to define these issues.

Although progress has been made in scoring the functional impact of individual mutations, the characteristics of the genes in which those mutations are found remain largely unexplored. For example, genes known to carry few common functional variants in healthy individuals may be judged more likely to cause certain kinds of disease than genes known to carry many such variants. Until now, however, it has not been possible to develop a quantitative assessment of how well genes tolerate functional genetic variation on a genome-wide scale. Here we describe an effort that uses sequence data from 6503 whole exome sequences made available by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). Specifically, we develop an intolerance scoring system that assesses whether genes have relatively more or less functional genetic variation than expected based on the apparently neutral variation found in the gene. To illustrate the utility of this intolerance score, we show that genes responsible for Mendelian diseases are significantly more intolerant to functional genetic variation than genes that do not cause any known disease, but with striking variation in intolerance among genes causing different classes of genetic disease. We conclude by showing that use of an intolerance ranking system can aid in interpreting personal genomes and identifying pathogenic mutations.","pmid":"23990802","apaCitation":"Petrovski, S, Wang, Q, Heinzen, EL, Allen, AS, & Goldstein, DB.

Exome sequencing identified one homozygous variant shared among all affected individuals and absent in controls: a 1 bp frameshift TECPR2 deletion leading to a premature stop codon and predicting significant degradation of the protein. TECPR2 has been reported as a positive regulator of autophagy. We thus examined the autophagy-related fate of two key autophagic proteins, SQSTM1 (p62) and MAP1LC3B (LC3), in skin fibroblasts of an affected individual, as compared to a healthy control, and found that both protein levels were decreased and that there was a more pronounced decrease in the lipidated form of LC3 (LC3II). siRNA knockdown of TECPR2 showed similar changes, consistent with aberrant autophagy. Our results are strengthened by the fact that autophagy dysfunction has been implicated in a number of other neurodegenerative diseases. The discovered TECPR2 mutation implicates autophagy, a central intracellular mechanism, in spastic paraparesis.","pmid":"23176824","apaCitation":"Oz-Levi, D, Ben-Zeev, B, Ruzzo, EK, Hitomi, Y, Gelman, A, Pelak, K, Anikster, Y, Reznik-Wolf, H, Bar-Joseph, I, Olender, T, Alkelai, A, Weiss, M, Ben-Asher, E, Ge, D, Shianna, KV, Elazar, Z, Goldstein, DB, Pras, E, & Lancet, D.

However, in the vast majority of these cases, the causal variants responsible for the observed associations remain unknown. In order to facilitate the identification of causal variants, we designed a simple computational method called the \"preferential linkage disequilibrium (LD)\" approach, which follows the variants discovered by GWASs to pinpoint the causal variants, even if they are rare compared with the discovery variants. The approach is based on the hypothesis that the GWAS-discovered variant is better at tagging the causal variants than are most other variants evaluated in the original GWAS. Applying the preferential LD approach to the GWAS signals of five human traits for which the causal variants are already known, we successfully placed the known causal variants among the top ten candidates in the majority of these cases. Application of this method to additional GWASs, including those of hepatitis C virus treatment response, plasma levels of clotting factors, and late-onset Alzheimer disease, has led to the identification of a number of promising candidate causal variants. This method represents a useful tool for delineating causal variants by bringing together GWAS signals and the rapidly accumulating variant data from next-generation sequencing.","pmid":"22939045","apaCitation":"Zhu, Q, Ge, D, Heinzen, EL, Dickson, SP, Urban, TJ, Zhu, M, Maia, JM, He, M, Zhao, Q, Shianna, KV, & Goldstein, DB.

We found that for common CNVs and high-coverage genomes, ERDS performs as well as the best method currently available (Genome STRiP), whereas for rare CNVs and high-coverage genomes, ERDS performs better than any available method. Importantly, ERDS accommodates both unique and highly amplified regions of the genome and does so without requiring separate alignments for calling CNVs and other variants.

In a subsequent sequence analysis of ATP1A3 in 98 other patients with AHC, we found that ATP1A3 mutations were likely to be responsible for at least 74% of the cases; we also identified one inherited mutation in a case of familial AHC. Notably, most AHC cases are caused by one of seven recurrent ATP1A3 mutations, one of which was observed in 36 patients. Unlike ATP1A3 mutations that cause rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism, AHC-causing mutations in this gene caused consistent reductions in ATPase activity without affecting the level of protein expression.

Rare copy-number variants have been found to explain nearly 3% of individuals with IGE; however, it remains unclear whether variants with moderate effect size and frequencies below what are reliably detected with genome-wide association studies contribute significantly to disease risk. In this study, we compare the exome sequences of 118 individuals with IGE and 242 controls of European ancestry by using next-generation sequencing. The exome-sequenced epilepsy cases include study subjects with two forms of IGE, including juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (n = 93) and absence epilepsy (n = 25). However, our discovery strategy did not assume common genetic control between the subtypes of IGE considered. In the sequence data, as expected, no variants were significantly associated with the IGE phenotype or more specific IGE diagnoses. We then selected 3,897 candidate epilepsy-susceptibility variants from the sequence data and genotyped them in a larger set of 878 individuals with IGE and 1,830 controls. Again, no variant achieved statistical significance. However, 1,935 variants were observed exclusively in cases either as heterozygous or homozygous genotypes. It is likely that this set of variants includes real risk factors. The lack of significant association evidence of single variants with disease in this two-stage approach emphasizes the high genetic heterogeneity of epilepsy disorders, suggests that the impact of any individual single-nucleotide variant in this disease is small, and indicates that gene-based approaches might be more successful for future sequencing studies of epilepsy predisposition.","pmid":"22863189","apaCitation":"Heinzen, EL, Depondt, C, Cavalleri, GL, Ruzzo, EK, Walley, NM, Need, AC, Ge, D, He, M, Cirulli, ET, Zhao, Q, Cronin, KD, Gumbs, CE, Campbell, CR, Hong, LK, Maia, JM, Shianna, KV, McCormack, M, Radtke, RA, O'Conner, GD, Mikati, MA, Gallentine, WB, Husain, AM, Sinha, SR, Chinthapalli, K, Puranam, RS, McNamara, JO, Ottman, R, Sisodiya, SM, Delanty, N, & Goldstein, DB.

There is strong interest in identifying genetic risk factors that can help to elucidate the pathophysiology and that might result in the development of improved treatments. Linkage and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) suggest that the genetic basis of schizophrenia is heterogeneous. However, it remains unclear whether the underlying genetic variants are mostly moderately rare and can be identified by the genotyping of variants observed in sequenced cases in large follow-up cohorts or whether they will typically be much rarer and therefore more effectively identified by gene-based methods that seek to combine candidate variants. Here, we consider 166 persons who have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and who have had either their genomes or their exomes sequenced to high coverage. From these data, we selected 5,155 variants that were further evaluated in an independent cohort of 2,617 cases and 1,800 controls. No single variant showed a study-wide significant association in the initial or follow-up cohorts. However, we identified a number of case-specific variants, some of which might be real risk factors for schizophrenia, and these can be readily interrogated in other data sets. Our results indicate that schizophrenia risk is unlikely to be predominantly influenced by variants just outside the range detectable by GWASs. Rather, multiple rarer genetic variants must contribute substantially to the predisposition to schizophrenia, suggesting that both very large sample sizes and gene-based association tests will be required for securely identifying genetic risk factors.","pmid":"22863191","apaCitation":"Need, AC, McEvoy, JP, Gennarelli, M, Heinzen, EL, Ge, D, Maia, JM, Shianna, KV, He, M, Cirulli, ET, Gumbs, CE, Zhao, Q, Campbell, CR, Hong, L, Rosenquist, P, Putkonen, A, Hallikainen, T, Repo-Tiihonen, E, Tiihonen, J, Levy, DL, Meltzer, HY, & Goldstein, DB.

Because these severe side effects occur only in certain individuals, identifying genetic or environmental variables that influence cognitive response would be of great utility in determining whether to administer this drug to a patient. We gave an acute 100 mg oral dose of topiramate to 158 healthy volunteers and measured how the drug changed their performance on a diverse battery of cognitive tests. We found a wide range of responses to topiramate, and we demonstrated that not all tests in the battery were equally affected. There was no correlation between the effect of topiramate and either education level or baseline cognitive performance. Of interest, there was an up to 55-fold variation in the topiramate plasma levels of the participants. Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of cognitive response did not reveal any genome-wide significant associations; the study was powered to find variants explaining at least 25% of the variation in cognitive response. Combining the results of this GWAS with a retrospective study of cognitive complaints in 290 epilepsy patients who received topiramate as part of their treatment also did not result in a significant association.

Rare copy-number variants have been found to explain nearly 3% of individuals with IGE; however, it remains unclear whether variants with moderate effect size and frequencies below what are reliably detected with genome-wide association studies contribute significantly to disease risk. In this study, we compare the exome sequences of 118 individuals with IGE and 242 controls of European ancestry by using next-generation sequencing. The exome-sequenced epilepsy cases include study subjects with two forms of IGE, including juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (n = 93) and absence epilepsy (n = 25). However, our discovery strategy did not assume common genetic control between the subtypes of IGE considered. In the sequence data, as expected, no variants were significantly associated with the IGE phenotype or more specific IGE diagnoses. We then selected 3,897 candidate epilepsy-susceptibility variants from the sequence data and genotyped them in a larger set of 878 individuals with IGE and 1,830 controls. Again, no variant achieved statistical significance. However, 1,935 variants were observed exclusively in cases either as heterozygous or homozygous genotypes. It is likely that this set of variants includes real risk factors. The lack of significant association evidence of single variants with disease in this two-stage approach emphasizes the high genetic heterogeneity of epilepsy disorders, suggests that the impact of any individual single-nucleotide variant in this disease is small, and indicates that gene-based approaches might be more successful for future sequencing studies of epilepsy predisposition.

Approximately 10% of cases are familial (FALS), typically with a dominant inheritance mode. Despite numerous advances in recent years, nearly 50% of FALS cases have unknown genetic aetiology. Here we show that mutations within the profilin 1 (PFN1) gene can cause FALS. PFN1 is crucial for the conversion of monomeric (G)-actin to filamentous (F)-actin. Exome sequencing of two large ALS families showed different mutations within the PFN1 gene. Further sequence analysis identified 4 mutations in 7 out of 274 FALS cases. Cells expressing PFN1 mutants contain ubiquitinated, insoluble aggregates that in many cases contain the ALS-associated protein TDP-43. PFN1 mutants also display decreased bound actin levels and can inhibit axon outgrowth. Furthermore, primary motor neurons expressing mutant PFN1 display smaller growth cones with a reduced F/G-actin ratio. These observations further document that cytoskeletal pathway alterations contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Â© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Methods: We studied the relationship between IL28B 16 gene-related SNP rs12979860 and early viral kinetics (day 0-28) 17 during peginterferon and ribavirin treatment, in 171 African 18 Americans (AA) and 188 Caucasian Americans (CA) with HCV 19 genotype 1. Results: Compared to non-C/C genotypes, C/C was associated with greater declines in serum HCV RNA during phase 1 (day 0-2), phase 2 (day 7-28), and day 0-28 and higher response (undetected HCV RNA) rates at weeks 4 and 12 in AA and CA. A static phase and increases in HCV RNA from day 2 to 7 were more common in patients with non-C/C genotypes. C/C was also associated with higher week 24, 48, and 72 response rates in CA (p <0.01) but not in AA. At baseline, SNP genotype was the only independent predictor of phase 1; SNP genotype and phase 1 were independent predictors of phase 2 (p <0.001). There were no racial differences in HCV RNA declines during phase 1, day 2-7, phase 2, and day 0-28 with the same SNP genotype. AA with C/C and C/T genotypes had lower week 24, 48, and 72 (SVR) rates than did CA (p = 0.03). SNP C/C predicted higher SVR rates in AA and CA with high baseline HCV RNA (â¥600,000 IU/ml), and in CA with â¥1 log 10 IU/ml decrease in HCV RNA from day 0 to 28. Conclusions: SNP rs12979860 is strongly associated with both phase 1 and phase 2 HCV RNA kinetics in AA and CA with HCV genotype 1. Â© 2011 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

METHODS: We identified three families with a dominantly inherited complex of cold-induced urticaria, antibody deficiency, and susceptibility to infection and autoimmunity. Immunophenotyping methods included flow cytometry, analysis of serum immunoglobulins and autoantibodies, lymphocyte stimulation, and enzymatic assays. Genetic studies included linkage analysis, targeted Sanger sequencing, and next-generation wholegenome sequencing. RESULTS: Cold urticaria occurred in all affected subjects. Other, variable manifestations included atopy, granulomatous rash, autoimmune thyroiditis, the presence of antinuclear antibodies, sinopulmonary infections, and common variable immunodeficiency. Levels of serum IgM and IgA and circulating natural killer cells and class-switched memory B cells were reduced. Linkage analysis showed a 7-Mb candidate interval on chromosome 16q in one family, overlapping by 3.5 Mb a disease-associated haplotype in a smaller family. This interval includes PLCG2, encoding phospholipase CÎ³ 2 (PLCÎ³ 2), a signaling molecule expressed in B cells, natural killer cells, and mast cells. Sequencing of complementary DNA revealed heterozygous transcripts lacking exon 19 in two families and lacking exons 20 through 22 in a third family. Genomic sequencing identified three distinct in-frame deletions that cosegregated with disease. These deletions, located within a region encoding an autoinhibitory domain, result in protein products with constitutive phospholipase activity. PLCG2-expressing cells had diminished cellular signaling at 37Â°C but enhanced signaling at subphysiologic temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic deletions in PLCG2 cause gain of PLCÎ³ 2 function, leading to signaling abnormalities in multiple leukocyte subsets and a phenotype encompassing both excessive and deficient immune function.

There is strong interest in identifying genetic risk factors that can help to elucidate the pathophysiology and that might result in the development of improved treatments. Linkage and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) suggest that the genetic basis of schizophrenia is heterogeneous. However, it remains unclear whether the underlying genetic variants are mostly moderately rare and can be identified by the genotyping of variants observed in sequenced cases in large follow-up cohorts or whether they will typically be much rarer and therefore more effectively identified by gene-based methods that seek to combine candidate variants. Here, we consider 166 persons who have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and who have had either their genomes or their exomes sequenced to high coverage. From these data, we selected 5,155 variants that were further evaluated in an independent cohort of 2,617 cases and 1,800 controls. No single variant showed a study-wide significant association in the initial or follow-up cohorts. However, we identified a number of case-specific variants, some of which might be real risk factors for schizophrenia, and these can be readily interrogated in other data sets. Our results indicate that schizophrenia risk is unlikely to be predominantly influenced by variants just outside the range detectable by GWASs.

IL28B acts on interferon-stimulated genes via the JAK-STAT pathway, which has been implicated in development of insulin resistance. We investigated whether IL28B polymorphisms are associated with posttransplant diabetes mellitus (DM). Consecutive HCV patients who underwent liver transplantation between 1-1995 and 1-2011 were studied. Genotyping of the polymorphism rs12979860 was performed on DNA collected from donors and recipients. Posttransplant DM was screened for by fasting blood glucoses every 1-3 months. Of 221 included patients, 69 developed posttransplant DM (31%). Twenty-two patients with recipient IL28B genotype TT (48%), 25 with IL28B genotype CT (25%) and 22 with IL28B genotype CC (29%) developed posttransplant DM. TT genotype was statistically significantly associated with posttransplant DM over time (log rank p = 0.012 for TT vs. CT and p = 0.045 for TT vs. CC). Multivariate Cox regression analysis correcting for donor age, body mass index, baseline serum glucose, baseline serum cholesterol, recipient age and treated rejection, showed that recipient IL28B genotype TT was independently associated with posttransplant DM (hazard ratio 2.51; 95% confidence interval 1.17-5.40; p = 0.011). We conclude that the risk of developing posttransplant DM is significantly increased in recipients carrying the TT polymorphism of the IL28B gene. An analysis of liver transplant recipients with hepatitis C virus infection finds that the risk of developing posttransplant diabetes mellitus is significantly increased in recipients carrying the TT polymorphism of the IL28B gene.

Its role on disease biology and progression is less clear. We characterized the effects of IL28B genotype on HCV recurrence, allograft histology, rate of SVR, and survival after liver transplantation (LT) in HCV. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent LT with HCV were studied. The rs12979860 genotype from both the donor was and recipient was determined. Measured endpoints included histologic HCV recurrence (inflammatory grade and fibrosis stage), acute cellular rejection, SVR, retransplantation, and death. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 272 consecutive LT in 255 patients. C-allele frequency was 56% in recipients and 70% in donors (P<0.001). Recipient IL28B CC genotype was associated with lower alanine aminotransferase levels and viral load at recurrence and a lower frequency of F2 on liver biopsy at 1 year after LT, when compared with the non-CC genotype (P=0.012). The opposite was observed in LT with donor CC genotype (P=0.003). Both recipient and donor CC genotype favored SVR, and when the two of them occurred together, the SVR rate reached 90%. Survival analysis after 5.5 years of follow-up showed a higher rate of progression to cirrhosis (hazard ratio, 5.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-27.6), liver-related death, or retransplantation among liver transplant recipients with a CC genotype donor. CONCLUSIONS: The IL28B genotype is predictive not only of SVR but also of the histologic diagnosis of posttransplant hepatitis C, with donor CC genotype favoring inflammation and fibrosis, and adverse outcomes during long-term follow-up. A favorable effect of donor CC genotype is manifest only after antiviral therapy.

We quantified the number of copies of KIR3DS1 and KIR3DL1 in a large HIV-1 positive cohort, and showed that an increase in KIR3DS1 count associates with a lower viral set point if its putative ligand is present (p = 0.00028), as does an increase in KIR3DL1 count in the presence of KIR3DS1 and appropriate ligands for both receptors (p = 0.0015). We further provide functional data that demonstrate that NK cells from individuals with multiple copies of KIR3DL1, in the presence of KIR3DS1 and the appropriate ligands, inhibit HIV-1 replication more robustly, and associated with a significant expansion in the frequency of KIR3DS1+, but not KIR3DL1+, NK cells in their peripheral blood.

As an unbiased approach to identifying genomic regions of importance in complex human disease, the results of such studies have the potential to illuminate novel causal pathways, guide mechanistic research, and aid in prediction of disease risk. The use of a genome-wide approach presents considerable methodological and statistical challenges, and properly conducted studies are essential to avoid false-positive results. A total of 22 GWA studies have been published in pulmonary medicine thus far, implicating several intriguing genomic regions in the determination of pulmonary function measures, onset of asthma, and susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Many questions remain, however, as most identified genetic variants contribute only nominally to overall disease risk, genetic disease mechanisms remain uncertain, and disease-associated variants are not consistent across studies. Perhaps most fundamentally, the association signals identified have not yet been traced to causal variants. This perspective will review the current state of GWA studies in pulmonary disease. We begin with an introduction to the hypothesis, principles, and limitations of this type of genome-wide approach, highlight key points from available studies, and conclude by addressing future approaches to better understand the genetics of complex pulmonary disease.","pmid":"21799071","apaCitation":"Todd, JL, Goldstein, DB, Ge, D, Christie, J, & Palmer, SM.

A naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphism in the human BDNF gene (val66met) has been associated with altered intercellular trafficking and regulated secretion of BDNF in met compared to val carriers. Additionally, previous studies have found a relationship between the BDNF val66met genotype and functional activity in the hippocampus during episodic and working memory tasks in healthy young adults. Specifically, studies have found that met carriers exhibit both poorer performance and reduced neural activity within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) when performing episodic memory tasks. However, these studies have not been well replicated and have not considered the role of behavioral differences in the interpretation of neural differences. The current study sought to control for cognitive performance in investigating the role of the BDNF val66met genotype on neural activity associated with episodic memory. Across item and relational memory tests, met carriers exhibited increased MTL activation during both encoding and retrieval stages, compared to noncarriers. The results suggest that met carriers are able to recruit MTL activity to support successful memory processes, and reductions in cognitive performance observed in prior studies are not a ubiquitous effect associated with variants of the BDNF val66met genotype.","pmid":"20865733","apaCitation":"Dennis, NA, Cabeza, R, Need, AC, Waters-Metenier, S, Goldstein, DB, & LaBar, KS.

Here, we address this question for humans specifically from the perspective of population allele frequency of variants across the complete genome, including both coding and noncoding regions. We establish simple criteria to assess the likelihood that variants are functional based on their genomic locations and then use whole-genome sequence data from 29 subjects of European origin to assess the relationship between the functional properties of variants and their population allele frequencies. We find that for all criteria used to assess the likelihood that a variant is functional, the rarer variants are significantly more likely to be functional than the more common variants. Strikingly, these patterns disappear when we focus on only those variants in which the major alleles are derived. These analyses indicate that the majority of the genetic variation in terms of phenotypic consequence may result from a mutation-selection balance, as opposed to balancing selection, and have direct relevance to the study of human disease.","pmid":"21457907","apaCitation":"Zhu, Q, Ge, D, Maia, JM, Zhu, M, Petrovski, S, Dickson, SP, Heinzen, EL, Shianna, KV, & Goldstein, DB.

Detection of such genetic abnormalities in patients being evaluated for surgical treatment might raise concern that a genetic defect, possibly widely expressed in the brain, will affect surgical outcome. Methods: A reevaluation was undertaken of clinical presurgical data, histopathology of surgical specimen, and postsurgical outcome in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) who have had surgical treatment for their drug-resistant seizures, and who have been found to have particular genomic microdeletions. Key Findings: Three thousand eight hundred twelve patients with epilepsy were genotyped and had a genome-wide screen to identify copy number variation. Ten patients with MTLE, who had resective epilepsy surgery, were found to have 16p13.11 microdeletions or other microdeletions >1 Mb. On histopathology, eight had classical hippocampal sclerosis (HS), one had nonspecific findings, and one had a hamartoma. Median postsurgical follow-up time was 48 months (range 10-156 months). All patients with HS were seizure-free after surgery, International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) outcome class 1, at last follow-up; the patient with nonspecific pathology had recurrence of infrequent seizures after 7 years of seizure freedom. The patient with a hamartoma never became seizure-free. Significance: Large microdeletions can be found in patients with \"typical\" MTLE. In this small series, patients with MTLE who meet criteria for resective surgery and harbor large microdeletions, at least those we have detected, can have a good postsurgical outcome. Our findings add to the spectrum of causal heterogeneity of MTLE + HS.

Mathematical models of hepatitis C virus (HCV) during therapy may elucidate mechanisms of action for antiviral therapy. In genome-wide association studies, IL28B gene polymorphisms are highly predictive of therapeutic clearance of HCV. Methods. We collected sera from 20 chronically infected HCV participants at 13 points during the first 28 days of therapy. We assessed the presence of the C allele at single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12979860 using the ABI TaqMan allelic discrimination kit. We estimated dynamic parameters from the entire population using the Neumann model for HCV infection. Statistical methods for repeated nonlinear measures compared model parameters by established predictors of response. Results. The frequencies of IL28B genotypes were 6 (C/C), 11 (C/T), and 3 (T/T). The mean log decline in HCV RNA from 0 to 48 hours was more rapid among C/C genotype participants compared with C/T or T/T genotype participants (1.4 vs 0.7; P = .07), and from 2 days to 14 days (1.6 vs 0.7; P = .04). In the multivariate model, the C/C genotype predicted a steeper second-phase decline when adjusted for race (P = .01). Conclusions. The presence of the C/C genotype at IL28B rs12979860 exerts its antiviral effect by increasing the infected hepatocyte death rate. This suggests that an immune-mediated mechanism is responsible.

Amoxicillin-clavulanate (AC) is a leading cause of idiosyncratic DILI, but little is understood about genetic susceptibility to this adverse reaction. Methods: We performed a genome-wide association study using 822,927 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from 201 White European and US cases of DILI following AC administration (AC-DILI) and 532 population controls, matched for genetic background. Results: AC-DILI was associated with many loci in the major histocompatibility complex. The strongest effect was with an HLA class II SNP (rs9274407, P = 4.8 Ã 10-14), which correlated with rs3135388, a tag SNP of HLA-DRB1 (*)1501-DQB1 (*)0602 that was previously associated with AC-DILI. Conditioned on rs3135388, rs9274407 is still significant (P = 1.1 Ã 10-4). An independent association was observed in the class I region (rs2523822, P = 1.8 Ã 10-10), related to HLA-A (*)0201. The most significant class I and II SNPs showed statistical interaction (P =.0015). High-resolution HLA genotyping (177 cases and 219 controls) confirmed associations of HLA-A (*)0201 (P = 2 Ã 10-6) and HLA-DQB1 (*)0602 (P = 5 Ã 10-10) and their interaction (P =.005). Additional, population-dependent effects were observed in HLA alleles with nominal significance. In an analysis of autoimmune-related genes, rs2476601 in the gene PTPN22 was associated (P = 1.3 Ã 10-4). Conclusions: Class I and II HLA genotypes affect susceptibility to AC-DILI, indicating the importance of the adaptive immune response in pathogenesis. The HLA genotypes identified will be useful in studies of the pathogenesis of AC-DILI but have limited utility as predictive or diagnostic biomarkers because of the low positive predictive values.

There is scarce information regarding the influence of this IL28B SNP on early viral kinetics during therapy, particularly in patients coinfected with HIV, in whom treatment response is lower than in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-monoinfected patients. Methods: We selected 196 HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals who had completed a course of peginterferon-ribavirin therapy, and a validated outcome for SVR. Association of IL28B SNPs with rapid, early and end-of-treatment virological responses [rapid virological response (RVR), early virological response (EVR) and end of treatment virological response, respectively] was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Rate of SVR in the study population was 54%. Frequency of the IL28B CC genotype was 44%. The distribution of HCV genotypes was as follows: HCV-1 57%, HCV-2 1%, HCV-3 30% and HCV-4 12%. Compared to CT/TT, the CC genotype was associated with significantly higher rates of all on-treatment viral outcomes, after adjusting for other predictors of viral response as serum HCV-RNA, HCV genotype and liver fibrosis staging. IL28B CC genotype kept its predictive power of SVR in patients who did not achieve RVR or cEVR. The association between IL28B SNP and viral kinetics and treatment outcomes was significant only for HCV genotypes 1 and 4. Conclusion: IL28B CC genotype is a strong predictor of virological response to therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. This effect is mediated by an increase in viral clearance during the first 12 weeks of treatment and is mainly seen in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4.

The HLA-B*1502 allele has been shown to be strongly correlated with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN) in the Han Chinese and other Asian populations but not in European populations. METHODS: We performed a genomewide association study of samples obtained from 22 subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, 43 subjects with carbamazepine-induced maculopapular exanthema, and 3987 control subjects, all of European descent. We tested for an association between disease and HLA alleles through proxy single-nucleotide polymorphisms and imputation, confirming associations by high-resolution sequence-based HLA typing. We replicated the associations in samples from 145 subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions. RESULTS: The HLA-A*3101 allele, which has a prevalence of 2 to 5% in Northern European populations, was significantly associated with the hypersensitivity syndrome (P = 3.5Ã10-8). An independent genomewide association study of samples from subjects with maculopapular exanthema also showed an association with the HLA-A* 3101 allele (P = 1.1Ã10-6). Follow-up genotyping confirmed the variant as a risk factor for the hypersensitivity syndrome (odds ratio, 12.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 121.03), maculopapular exanthema (odds ratio, 8.33; 95% CI, 3.59 to 19.36), and SJS-TEN (odds ratio, 25.93; 95% CI, 4.93 to 116.18). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the HLA-A*3101 allele was associated with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions among subjects of Northern European ancestry. The presence of the allele increased the risk from 5.0% to 26.0%, whereas its absence reduced the risk from 5.0% to 3.8%.

The authors used genome-wide data from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to assess whether differences in type of population (622 seroconverters vs. 636 seroprevalent subjects) or the number of measurements available for defining the phenotype resulted in differences in the effect sizes of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and the phenotype, HIV-1 viral load at set point. The effect estimate for the top 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms was 0.092 (95% confidence interval: 0.074, 0.110) log10 viral load (log10 copies of HIV-1 per mL of blood) greater in seroconverters than in seroprevalent subjects. The difference was even larger when the authors focused on chromosome 6 variants (0.153 log10 viral load) or on variants that achieved genome-wide significance (0.232 log10 viral load). The estimates of the genetic effects tended to be slightly larger when more viral load measurements were available, particularly among seroconverters and for variants that achieved genome-wide significance. Differences in phenotype definition and ascertainment may affect the estimated magnitude of genetic effects and should be considered in optimizing power for discovering new associations.

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for host genetic variants modifying HIV-1 acquisition and viral control in the context of a cohort of African HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples. To minimize misclassification of HIV-1 risk, we quantified HIV-1 exposure, using data including plasma HIV-1 concentrations, gender, and condom use. Methods: We matched couples without HIV-1 seroconversion to those with seroconversion by quantified HIV-1 exposure risk. Logistic regression of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 798 samples from 496 HIV-1 infected and 302 HIV-1 exposed, uninfected individuals was performed to identify factors associated with HIV-1 acquisition. In addition, a linear regression analysis was performed using SNP data from a subset (n = 403) of HIV-1 infected individuals to identify factors predicting plasma HIV-1 concentrations. Results: After correcting for multiple comparisons, no SNPs were significantly associated with HIV-1 infection status or plasma HIV-1 concentrations. Conclusion: This GWAS controlling for HIV-1 exposure did not identify common host genotypes influencing HIV-1 acquisition. Alternative strategies, such as large-scale sequencing to identify low frequency variation, should be considered for identifying novel host genetic predictors of HIV-1 acquisition.

We sought to determine the prevalence and impact on clinical outcomes of donor and recipient IL28B genotypes among liver transplant recipients. The cohort study included 189 consecutive patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who underwent liver transplantation between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2005, at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Genotyping of the polymorphism rs12979860 was performed on DNA collected from all donors and recipients in the cohort. Sixty-five patients received IFN-based antiviral therapy. The CC IL28B variant was less common in the chronic HCV-infected recipients than in non-HCV donor livers (33% versus 47%, P = 0.03). IL28B recipient genotype was significantly predictive of fibrosis stage, with TT genotype being associated with more rapid fibrosis (Pearson chi-square P = 0.024 for the comparison G versus A). Donor and recipient IL28B genotype were independently associated with sustained virologic response (P < 0.005).

Mean IP-10 was lower in sustained responders compared with nonresponders (437 Â± 31 vs 704 Â± 44 pg/mL, P < 0.001), both in AA and CA patients. The positive predictive value of low IP-10 levels (<600 pg/mL) for SVR was 69%, whereas the negative predictive value of high IP-10 levels (>600 pg/mL) was 67%. We assessed the combination of pretreatment IP-10 levels with IL28B genotype as predictors of treatment response. The IL28B polymorphism rs12979860 was tested in 210 participants. The CC, CT, and TT genotypes were found in 30%, 49%, and 21% of patients, respectively, with corresponding SVR rates of 87%, 50%, and 39% (P < 0.0001). Serum IP-10 levels within the IL28B genotype groups provided additional information regarding the likelihood of SVR (P < 0.0001). CT carriers with low IP-10 had 64% SVR versus 24% with high IP-10. Similarly, a higher SVR rate was identified for TT and CC carriers with low versus high IP-10 (TT, 48% versus 20%; CC, 89% versus 79%). IL28B genotype and baseline IP-10 levels were additive but independent when predicting SVR in both AA and CA patients. Conclusion: When IL28B genotype is combined with pretreatment serum IP-10 measurement, the predictive value for discrimination between SVR and nonresponse is significantly improved, especially in non-CC genotypes. This relationship warrants further investigation to elucidate the mechanisms of antiviral response and prospective validation Â© 2010 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","pmid":"21254158","apaCitation":"Darling, JM, Aerssens, J, Fanning, G, Mchutchison, JG, Goldstein, DB, Thompson, AJ, Shianna, KV, Afdhal, NH, Hudson, ML, Howell, CD, Talloen, W, Bollekens, J, Wit, MD, Scholliers, A, & Fried, MW.

We hypothesized that IL28B polymorphism is associated with intrahepatic expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), known to influence treatment outcome. IL28B genotyping (rs12979860) and whole-genome RNA expression were performed using liver biopsies from 61 North American patients with CHC. After correction for multiple testing (false discovery rate < 0.10), 164 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed by IL28B-type. The interferon signaling pathway was the most enriched canonical pathway differentially expressed by IL28B-type (P < 10(-5)), with most genes showing higher expression in livers of individuals carrying the poor-response IL28B-type. In 25 patients for which treatment response data were available, IL28B-type was associated with SVR (P = 0.0054). ISG expression was also associated with SVR; however, this was not independent of IL28B-type. Analysis of miR-122 expression in liver biopsies showed reduced miR-122 levels associated with poorer treatment outcome, independently of IL28B-type. No association was observed between IL28B-type and levels of liver IL28B or IL28A messenger RNA expression.

No data are available for genotype 2/3 HCV. We evaluated the association between the casual ITPA variants and on-treatment anemia in a well-characterized cohort of genotype 2/3 patients treated with variable-duration pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN-Î±2b) and RBV. Two hundred thirty-eight Caucasian patients were included in this retrospective study [185 (78%) with genotype 2 and 53 (22%) with genotype 3]. Patients were treated with PEG-IFN-Î±2b plus weight-based RBV (1000/1200 mg) for 12 (n = 109) or 24 weeks (n = 129). The ITPA polymorphisms rs1127354 and rs7270101 were genotyped, and an ITPase deficiency variable was defined that combined both ITPA variants according to their effect on ITPase activity. The primary endpoint was hemoglobin (Hb) reduction in week 4. We also considered Hb reduction over the course of therapy, the need for RBV dose modification, and the rate of sustained virological response (SVR). The ITPA variants were strongly and independently associated with protection from week 4 anemia (P = 10(-6) for rs1127354 and P = 10(-7) for rs7270101). Combining the variants into the ITPase deficiency variable increased the strength of association (P = 10(-11)). ITPase deficiency protected against anemia throughout treatment. ITPase deficiency was associated with a delayed time to an Hb level < 10 g/dL (hazard ratio = 0.25, 95% confidence interval = 0.08-0.84, P = 0.025) but not with the rate of RBV dose modification (required per protocol at Hb < 9.5 g/dL). There was no association between the ITPA variants and SVR. Conclusion: Two ITPA variants were strongly associated with protection against treatment-related anemia in patients with genotype 2/3 HCV, but they did not decrease the need for RBV dose reduction or increase the rate of SVR.

However, the actual genetic causes are largely unknown. In contrast to many other common diseases for which genetic association-studies have successfully revealed common variants associated with disease risk, the role of common variation in partial epilepsies has not yet been explored in a well-powered study. We undertook a genome-wide association-study to identify common variants which influence risk for epilepsy shared amongst partial epilepsy syndromes, in 3445 patients and 6935 controls of European ancestry. We did not identify any genome-wide significant association. A few single nucleotide polymorphisms may warrant further investigation. We exclude common genetic variants with effect sizes above a modest 1.3 odds ratio for a single variant as contributors to genetic susceptibility shared across the partial epilepsies. We show that, at best, common genetic variation can only have a modest role in predisposition to the partial epilepsies when considered across syndromes in Europeans. The genetic architecture of the partial epilepsies is likely to be very complex, reflecting genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Larger meta-analyses are required to identify variants of smaller effect sizes (odds ratio<1.3) or syndrome-specific variants. Further, our results suggest research efforts should also be directed towards identifying the multiple rare variants likely to account for at least part of the heritability of the partial epilepsies. Data emerging from genome-wide association-studies will be valuable during the next serious challenge of interpreting all the genetic variation emerging from whole-genome sequencing studies.","pmid":"20522523","apaCitation":"KasperaviciÅ«te, D, Catarino, CB, Heinzen, EL, Depondt, C, Cavalleri, GL, Caboclo, LO, Tate, SK, Jamnadas-Khoda, J, Chinthapalli, K, Clayton, LM, Shianna, KV, Radtke, RA, Mikati, MA, Gallentine, WB, Husain, AM, Alhusaini, S, Leppert, D, Middleton, LT, Gibson, RA, Johnson, MR, Matthews, PM, Hosford, D, Heuser, K, Amos, L, Ortega, M, Zumsteg, D, Wieser, HG, Steinhoff, BJ, KrÃ¤mer, G, Hansen, J, Dorn, T, Kantanen, AM, Gjerstad, L, Peuralinna, T, Hernandez, DG, Eriksson, KJ, KÃ¤lviÃ¤inen, RK, Doherty, CP, Wood, NW, Pandolfo, M, Duncan, JS, Sander, JW, Delanty, N, Goldstein, DB, & Sisodiya, SM.

This has been particularly pronounced for studies on psychiatric conditions, which have failed to produce clear, replicable associations for common variants. One popular explanation for these negative findings is that many of these traits may be genetically heterogeneous, leading to the idea that relevant endophenotypes may be more genetically tractable. Aspects of cognition may be the most important endophenotypes for psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, leading many researchers to pursue large-scale studies on the genetic contributors of cognitive performance in the normal population as a surrogate for aspects of liability to disease. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study with two tests of executive function, Digit Symbol and Stroop Color-Word, in 1086 healthy volunteers and with an expanded cognitive battery in 514 of these volunteers. We show that, consistent with published studies of the psychiatric conditions themselves, no single common variant has a large effect (explaining >4-8% of the population variation) on the performance of healthy individuals on standardized cognitive tests. Given that these are important endophenotypes, our work is consistent with the idea that identifying rare genetic causes of psychiatric conditions may be more important for future research than identifying genetically homogenous endophenotypes.","pmid":"20125193","apaCitation":"Cirulli, ET, KasperaviciÅ«te, D, Attix, DK, Need, AC, Ge, D, Gibson, G, & Goldstein, DB.

There have recently been conflicting reports in the literature concerning whether CCL3-like gene (CCL3L) copy number variation (CNV) is associated with resistance to HIV-1 acquisition and with both viral load and disease progression following infection with HIV-1. An association has also been reported between CCL3L CNV and clinical sequelae of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in vivo in rhesus monkeys. The present study was initiated to explore the possibility of an association of CCL3L CNV with the control of virus replication and AIDS progression in a carefully defined cohort of SIVmac251-infected, Indian-origin rhesus monkeys. Although we demonstrated extensive variation in copy number of CCL3L in this cohort of monkeys, CCL3L CNV was not significantly associated with either peak or set-point plasma SIV RNA levels in these monkeys when MHC class I allele Mamu-A*01 was included in the models or progression to AIDS in these monkeys. With 66 monkeys in the study, there was adequate power for these tests if the correlation of CCL3L and either peak or set-point plasma SIV RNA levels was 0.34 or 0.36, respectively. These findings call into question the premise that CCL3L CNV is important in HIV/SIV pathogenesis.","pmid":"20585621","apaCitation":"Lim, SY, Chan, T, Gelman, RS, Whitney, JB, O'Brien, KL, Barouch, DH, Goldstein, DB, Haynes, BF, & Letvin, NL.

The ability of new whole-genome sequencing technologies to rapidly indentify most of the genetic variants in any given genome opens an exciting opportunity to identify these disease genes. Here we sequenced the whole genome of a single patient with the dominant Mendelian disease, metachondromatosis (OMIM 156250), and used partial linkage data from her small family to focus our search for the responsible variant. In the proband, we identified an 11 bp deletion in exon four of PTPN11, which alters frame, results in premature translation termination, and co-segregates with the phenotype. In a second metachondromatosis family, we confirmed our result by identifying a nonsense mutation in exon 4 of PTPN11 that also co-segregates with the phenotype. Sequencing PTPN11 exon 4 in 469 controls showed no such protein truncating variants, supporting the pathogenicity of these two mutations. This combination of a new technology and a classical genetic approach provides a powerful strategy to discover the genes responsible for unexplained Mendelian disorders.","pmid":"20577567","apaCitation":"Sobreira, NL, Cirulli, ET, Avramopoulos, D, Wohler, E, Oswald, GL, Stevens, EL, Ge, D, Shianna, KV, Smith, JP, Maia, JM, Gumbs, CE, Pevsner, J, Thomas, G, Valle, D, Hoover-Fong, JE, & Goldstein, DB.

To evaluate the role of 16p13.11 deletions, as well as other structural variation, in epilepsy disorders, we used genome-wide screens to identify copy number variation in 3812 patients with a diverse spectrum of epilepsy syndromes and in 1299 neurologically-normal controls. Large deletions (> 100 kb) at 16p13.11 were observed in 23 patients, whereas no control had a deletion greater than 16 kb. Patients, even those with identically sized 16p13.11 deletions, presented with highly variable epilepsy phenotypes. For a subset of patients with a 16p13.11 deletion, we show a consistent reduction of expression for included genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency might contribute to pathogenicity. We also investigated another possible mechanism of pathogenicity by using hybridization-based capture and next-generation sequencing of the homologous chromosome for ten 16p13.11-deletion patients to look for unmasked recessive mutations. Follow-up genotyping of suggestive polymorphisms failed to identify any convincing recessive-acting mutations in the homologous interval corresponding to the deletion. The observation that two of the 16p13.11 deletions were larger than 2 Mb in size led us to screen for other large deletions. We found 12 additional genomic regions harboring deletions > 2 Mb in epilepsy patients, and none in controls. Additional evaluation is needed to characterize the role of these exceedingly large, non-locus-specific deletions in epilepsy. Collectively, these data implicate 16p13.11 and possibly other large deletions as risk factors for a wide range of epilepsy disorders, and they appear to point toward haploinsufficiency as a contributor to the pathogenicity of deletions.","pmid":"20398883","apaCitation":"Heinzen, EL, Radtke, RA, Urban, TJ, Cavalleri, GL, Depondt, C, Need, AC, Walley, NM, Nicoletti, P, Ge, D, Catarino, CB, Duncan, JS, KasperaviciÅ«te, D, Tate, SK, Caboclo, LO, Sander, JW, Clayton, L, Linney, KN, Shianna, KV, Gumbs, CE, Smith, J, Cronin, KD, Maia, JM, Doherty, CP, Pandolfo, M, Leppert, D, Middleton, LT, Gibson, RA, Johnson, MR, Matthews, PM, Hosford, D, KÃ¤lviÃ¤inen, R, Eriksson, K, Kantanen, AM, Dorn, T, Hansen, J, KrÃ¤mer, G, Steinhoff, BJ, Wieser, HG, Zumsteg, D, Ortega, M, Wood, NW, Huxley-Jones, J, Mikati, M, Gallentine, WB, Husain, AM, Buckley, PG, Stallings, RL, Podgoreanu, MV, Delanty, N, Sisodiya, SM, & Goldstein, DB.

Furthermore, based on the dopaminergic differences associated with the COMT val108/158met genotype, neural differences during cognition may be present, regardless of genotypic differences in cognitive performance. To investigate these issues the current study aimed to 1) examine the effects of COMT genotype using a large sample of healthy individuals (n = 496-1218) and multiple cognitive measures, and using a subset of the sample (n = 22), 2) examine whether COMT genotype effects medial temporal lobe (MTL) and frontal activity during successful relational memory processing, and 3) investigate group differences in functional connectivity associated with successful relational memory processing. Results revealed no significant group difference in cognitive performance between COMT genotypes in any of the 19 cognitive measures. However, in the subset sample, COMT val homozygotes exhibited significantly decreased MTL and increased prefrontal activity during both successful relational encoding and retrieval, and reduced connectivity between these regions compared with met homozygotes.

Here, our focus is on determining, genome-wide, the contribution of variable gene expression to viral control, and to relate it to genomic DNA polymorphism. RNA was extracted from purified CD4+ T-cells from 137 HIV-1 seroconverters, 16 elite controllers, and 3 healthy blood donors. Expression levels of more than 48,000 mRNA transcripts were assessed by the Human-6 v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Genome-wide SNP data was generated from genomic DNA using the HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina). We observed two distinct profiles with 260 genes differentially expressed depending on HIV-1 viral load. There was significant upregulation of expression of interferon stimulated genes with increasing viral load, including genes of the intrinsic antiretroviral defense. Upon successful antiretroviral treatment, the transcriptome profile of previously viremic individuals reverted to a pattern comparable to that of elite controllers and of uninfected individuals. Genome-wide evaluation of cis-acting SNPs identified genetic variants modulating expression of 190 genes. Those were compared to the genes whose expression was found associated with viral load: expression of one interferon stimulated gene, OAS1, was found to be regulated by a SNP (rs3177979, p = 4.9E-12); however, we could not detect an independent association of the SNP with viral setpoint. Thus, this study represents an attempt to integrate genome-wide SNP signals with genome-wide expression profiles in the search for biological correlates of HIV-1 control. It underscores the paradox of the association between increasing levels of viral load and greater expression of antiviral defense pathways. It also shows that elite controllers do not have a fully distinctive mRNA expression pattern in CD4+ T cells. Overall, changes in global RNA expression reflect responses to viral replication rather than a mechanism that might explain viral control.","pmid":"20195503","apaCitation":"Rotger, M, Dang, KK, Fellay, J, Heinzen, EL, Feng, S, Descombes, P, Shianna, KV, Ge, D, GÃ¼nthard, HF, Goldstein, DB, Telenti, A, Swiss HIV Cohort Study, , & Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology, .

It is generally thought that the associated markers reflect the effect of a nearby common (minor allele frequency >0.05) causal site, which is associated with the marker, leading to extensive resequencing efforts to find causal sites. We propose as an alternative explanation that variants much less common than the associated one may create \"synthetic associations\" by occurring, stochastically, more often in association with one of the alleles at the common site versus the other allele. Although synthetic associations are an obvious theoretical possibility, they have never been systematically explored as a possible explanation for GWAS findings. Here, we use simple computer simulations to show the conditions under which such synthetic associations will arise and how they may be recognized. We show that they are not only possible, but inevitable, and that under simple but reasonable genetic models, they are likely to account for or contribute to many of the recently identified signals reported in genome-wide association studies. We also illustrate the behavior of synthetic associations in real datasets by showing that rare causal mutations responsible for both hearing loss and sickle cell anemia create genome-wide significant synthetic associations, in the latter case extending over a 2.5-Mb interval encompassing scores of \"blocks\" of associated variants. In conclusion, uncommon or rare genetic variants can easily create synthetic associations that are credited to common variants, and this possibility requires careful consideration in the interpretation and follow up of GWAS signals.","pmid":"20126254","apaCitation":"Dickson, SP, Wang, K, Krantz, I, Hakonarson, H, & Goldstein, DB.

Although in some instances this may represent good fortune, cohorts of uninfected persons have been reported who are considered at high risk for infection. In these cohorts a variety of characteristics have been proposed as mediating protection, but to date only the 32-base pair deletion in the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 gene, which results in complete failure of cell surface expression of this coreceptor, has been associated with high-level protection from HIV infection. With this in mind, there are probably many other factors that may individually or in combination provide some level of protection from acquisition of HIV infection. Because some of these factors are probably incompletely protective or inconsistently active, identifying them with confidence will be difficult. Nonetheless, clarifying the determinants of protection against HIV infection is a high priority that will require careful selection of high-risk uninfected cohorts, who should undergo targeted studies of plausible mediators and broad screening for unexpected determinants of protection.

HLA-C-mediated immunity may be particularly protective because HIV-1 is unable to remove HLA-C from the cell surface, whereas it can avoid HLA-A- and HLA-B-mediated immunity by Nef-mediated down-modulation. However, some individuals with the protective -35CC genotype exhibit high viral loads. Here, we investigated whether the ability of HIV-1 to replicate efficiently in the \"protective\" high-HLA-C-expression host environment correlates with specific functional properties of Nef. We found that high set point viral loads (sVLs) were not associated with the emergence of Nef variants that had acquired the ability to down-modulate HLA-C or were more effective in removing HLA-A and HLA-B from the cell surface. However, in individuals with the protective -35CC genotype we found a significant association between sVLs and the efficiency of Nef-mediated enhancement of virion infectivity and modulation of CD4, CD28, and the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-associated invariant chain (Ii), while this was not observed in subjects with the -35TT genotype. Since the latter Nef functions all influence the stimulation of CD4+ T helper cells by antigen-presenting cells, they may cooperate to affect both the activation status of infected T cells and the generation of an antiviral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. In comparison, different levels of viremia in individuals with the common -35TT genotype were not associated with differences in Nef function but with differences in HLA-C mRNA expression levels. Thus, while high HLA-C expression may generally facilitate control of HIV-1, Nef may counteract HLA-C-mediated immune control in some individuals indirectly, by manipulating T-cell function and MHC-II antigen presentation.

A conventional fine-mapping effort starts by sequencing dozens of randomly selected samples at susceptibility loci to discover candidate variants, which are then placed on custom arrays or used in imputation algorithms to find the causal variants. We propose that one or several rare or low-frequency causal variants can hitchhike the same common tag SNP, so causal variants may not be easily unveiled by conventional efforts. Here, we first demonstrate that the true effect size and proportion of variance explained by a collection of rare causal variants can be underestimated by a common tag SNP, thereby accounting for some of the \"missing heritability\" in GWAS. We then describe a case-selection approach based on phasing long-range haplotypes and sequencing cases predicted to harbor causal variants. We compare this approach with conventional strategies on a simulated data set, and we demonstrate its advantages when multiple causal variants are present. We also evaluate this approach in a GWAS on hearing loss, where the most common causal variant has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 1.3% in the general population and 8.2% in 329 cases. With our case-selection approach, it is present in 88% of the 32 selected cases (MAF = 66%), so sequencing a subset of these cases can readily reveal the causal allele. Our results suggest that thinking beyond common variants is essential in interpreting GWAS signals and identifying causal variants.

After finding a paradoxically low urinary phenytoin metabolite (S)/(R) ratio in subjects receiving phenytoin maintenance therapy with a CYP2C9*1/*1 and CYP2C19*1/*2 geno-type, we hypothesized that CYP2C9 regulatory polymorphisms (rPMs), G-3089A and -2663delTG, in linkage disequilibrium with CYP2C19*2 were responsible. These rPMs explained as much as 10% of the variation in phenytoin maintenance dose in epileptic patients, but were not correlated with other patients' warfarin dose requirements or with phenytoin metabolite ratio in human liver microsomes. We hypothesized the rPMs affected CYP2C9 induction by phenytoin, a pregnane X receptor (PXR), and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activator. Transfection studies showed that CYP2C9 reporters with wild-type versus variant alleles had similar basal activity but significantly greater phenytoin induction by cotransfected PXR, CAR, and Nrf2 and less Yin Yang 1 transcription factor repression. Phenytoin induction of CYP2C9 was greater in human hepatocytes with the CYP2C9 wild type versus variant haplotype. Therefore, CYP2C9 rPMs affect phenytoin-dependent induction of CYP2C9 and phenytoin metabolism in humans, with an effect size comparable with that for CYP2C9*2 and 2C9*3. These findings may also be relevant to the clinical use of other PXR, CAR, and Nrf2 activators.

There have recently been conflicting reports in the literature concerning whether CCL3-like gene (CCL3L) copy number variation (CNV) is associated with resistance to HIV-1 acquisition and with both viral load and disease progression following infection with HIV-1. An association has also been reported between CCL3L CNV and clinical sequelae of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in vivo in rhesus monkeys. The present study was initiated to explore the possibility of an association of CCL3L CNV with the control of virus replication and AIDS progression in a carefully defined cohort of SIVmac251-infected, Indian-origin rhesus monkeys. Although we demonstrated extensive variation in copy number of CCL3L in this cohort of monkeys, CCL3L CNV was not significantly associated with either peak or set-point plasma SIV RNA levels in these monkeys when MHC class I allele Mamu-A*01 was included in the models or progression to AIDS in these monkeys. With 66 monkeys in the study, there was adequate power for these tests if the correlation of CCL3L and either peak or set-point plasma SIV RNA levels was 0.34 or 0.36, respectively. These findings call into question the premise that CCL3L CNV is important in HIV/SIV pathogenesis.","apaCitation":"Lim, SY, Chan, T, Gelman, RS, Whitney, JB, O'Brien, KL, Barouch, DH, Goldstein, DB, Haynes, BF, & Letvin, NL.

The ability of new whole-genome sequencing technologies to rapidly indentify most of the genetic variants in any given genome opens an exciting opportunity to identify these disease genes. Here we sequenced the whole genome of a single patient with the dominant Mendelian disease, metachondromatosis (OMIM 156250), and used partial linkage data from her small family to focus our search for the responsible variant. In the proband, we identified an 11 bp deletion in exon four of PTPN11, which alters frame, results in premature translation termination, and co-segregates with the phenotype. In a second metachondromatosis family, we confirmed our result by identifying a nonsense mutation in exon 4 of PTPN11 that also co-segregates with the phenotype. Sequencing PTPN11 exon 4 in 469 controls showed no such protein truncating variants, supporting the pathogenicity of these two mutations. This combination of a new technology and a classical genetic approach provides a powerful strategy to discover the genes responsible for unexplained Mendelian disorders.","apaCitation":"Sobreira, NLM, Cirulli, ET, Avramopoulos, D, Wohler, E, Oswald, GL, Stevens, EL, Ge, D, Shianna, KV, Smith, JP, Maia, JM, Gumbs, CE, Pevsner, J, Thomas, G, Valle, D, Hoover-Fong, JE, & Goldstein, DB.

Pharmacogenetics (PGx) has historical priority, according to its broadest meaning-relating heritable variation to inter-individual variation in drug response. Pharmacogenomics describes the study of differential gene-expression profiles in tissues of interest and their relation to drug-response phenotypes. This chapter focuses on inherited sequence variation, insertions deletions, copy number variations, micro-satellites, and Alu repeats and its association with treatment response end-points. A comprehensive review of gene-expression signatures, their association with response to chemotherapy, and search for underlying genetic determinants is presented. The discipline of PGx is closely tied to human genetics and genomics, focusing on specific phenotypes of interest. While disease predisposition research in the realm of non-Mendelian traits is faced with extremely complex etiology dictated by interplay between various pathways in the human body, pharmacogenetic phenotypes are largely governed by a limited number of molecules. Most of these interact with the drug as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic entities. Pharmacogenomics focuses on treatment efficacy, dosing, and safety. Â© 2010 Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

There has been great interest in studying cognitive measures as endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders, with the hope that their genetic basis will be clearer. To investigate this, we performed a genome-wide association study involving 11 cognitive phenotypes from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. We showed these measures to be heritable by comparing the correlation in 100 monozygotic and 100 dizygotic twin pairs. The full battery was tested in approximately 750 subjects, and for spatial and verbal recognition memory, we investigated a further 500 individuals to search for smaller genetic effects. We were unable to find any genome-wide significant associations with either SNPs or common copy number variants. Nor could we formally replicate any polymorphism that has been previously associated with cognition, although we found a weak signal of lower than expected P-values for variants in a set of 10 candidate genes. We additionally investigated SNPs in genomic loci that have been shown to harbor rare variants that associate with neuropsychiatric disorders, to see if they showed any suggestion of association when considered as a separate set. Only NRXN1 showed evidence of significant association with cognition. These results suggest that common genetic variation does not strongly influence cognition in healthy subjects and that cognitive measures do not represent a more tractable genetic trait than clinical endpoints such as schizophrenia. We discuss a possible role for rare variation in cognitive genomics.","pmid":"19734545","apaCitation":"Need, AC, Attix, DK, McEvoy, JM, Cirulli, ET, Linney, KL, Hunt, P, Ge, D, Heinzen, EL, Maia, JM, Shianna, KV, Weale, ME, Cherkas, LF, Clement, G, Spector, TD, Gibson, G, & Goldstein, DB.

As human genomics research progresses towards the whole-genome sequencing era, however, more clinically relevant results are likely to be discovered.

Most (70-80%) HCV infections persist and about 30% of individuals with persistent infection develop chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Epidemiological, viral and host factors have been associated with the differences in HCV clearance or persistence, and studies have demonstrated that a strong host immune response against HCV favours viral clearance. Thus, variation in genes involved in the immune response may contribute to the ability to clear the virus. In a recent genome-wide association study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs12979860) 3 kilobases upstream of the IL28B gene, which encodes the type III interferon IFN-3, was shown to associate strongly with more than a twofold difference in response to HCV drug treatment. To determine the potential effect of rs12979860 variation on outcome to HCV infection in a natural history setting, we genotyped this variant in HCV cohorts comprised of individuals who spontaneously cleared the virus (n = 388) or had persistent infection (n = 620). We show that the C/C genotype strongly enhances resolution of HCV infection among individuals of both European and African ancestry. To our knowledge, this is the strongest and most significant genetic effect associated with natural clearance of HCV, and these results implicate a primary role for IL28B in resolution of HCV infection.","pmid":"19759533","apaCitation":"Thomas, DL, Thio, CL, Martin, MP, Qi, Y, Ge, D, O'Huigin, C, Kidd, J, Kidd, K, Khakoo, SI, Alexander, G, Goedert, JJ, Kirk, GD, Donfield, SM, Rosen, HR, Tobler, LH, Busch, MP, McHutchison, JG, Goldstein, DB, & Carrington, M.

Although the recommended treatment for chronic infection involves a 48-week course of peginterferon-alpha-2b (PegIFN-alpha-2b) or -alpha-2a (PegIFN-alpha-2a) combined with ribavirin (RBV), it is well known that many patients will not be cured by treatment, and that patients of European ancestry have a significantly higher probability of being cured than patients of African ancestry. In addition to limited efficacy, treatment is often poorly tolerated because of side effects that prevent some patients from completing therapy. For these reasons, identification of the determinants of response to treatment is a high priority. Here we report that a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene, encoding interferon-lambda-3 (IFN-lambda-3), is associated with an approximately twofold change in response to treatment, both among patients of European ancestry (P = 1.06 x 10(-25)) and African-Americans (P = 2.06 x 10(-3)). Because the genotype leading to better response is in substantially greater frequency in European than African populations, this genetic polymorphism also explains approximately half of the difference in response rates between African-Americans and patients of European ancestry.","pmid":"19684573","apaCitation":"Ge, D, Fellay, J, Thompson, AJ, Simon, JS, Shianna, KV, Urban, TJ, Heinzen, EL, Qiu, P, Bertelsen, AH, Muir, AJ, Sulkowski, M, McHutchison, JG, & Goldstein, DB.

Research on pathogenesis has traditionally focused on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, particularly those involving dopamine. Schizophrenia has been considered a separate disease for over a century, but in the absence of clear biological markers, diagnosis has historically been based on signs and symptoms. A fundamental message emerging from genome-wide association studies of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with the disease is that its genetic basis does not necessarily conform to classical nosological disease boundaries. Certain CNVs confer not only high relative risk of schizophrenia but also of other psychiatric disorders. The structural variations associated with schizophrenia can involve several genes and the phenotypic syndromes, or the 'genomic disorders', have not yet been characterized. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies with the potential to implicate individual genes in complex diseases may reveal underlying biological pathways. Here we combined SNP data from several large genome-wide scans and followed up the most significant association signals. We found significant association with several markers spanning the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.3-22.1, a marker located upstream of the neurogranin gene (NRGN) on 11q24.2 and a marker in intron four of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) on 18q21.2. Our findings implicating the MHC region are consistent with an immune component to schizophrenia risk, whereas the association with NRGN and TCF4 points to perturbation of pathways involved in brain development, memory and cognition.","pmid":"19571808","apaCitation":"Stefansson, H, Ophoff, RA, Steinberg, S, Andreassen, OA, Cichon, S, Rujescu, D, Werge, T, PietilÃ¤inen, OP, Mors, O, Mortensen, PB, Sigurdsson, E, Gustafsson, O, Nyegaard, M, Tuulio-Henriksson, A, Ingason, A, Hansen, T, Suvisaari, J, Lonnqvist, J, Paunio, T, BÃ¸rglum, AD, Hartmann, A, Fink-Jensen, A, Nordentoft, M, Hougaard, D, Norgaard-Pedersen, B, BÃ¶ttcher, Y, Olesen, J, Breuer, R, MÃ¶ller, HJ, Giegling, I, Rasmussen, HB, Timm, S, Mattheisen, M, Bitter, I, RÃ©thelyi, JM, Magnusdottir, BB, Sigmundsson, T, Olason, P, Masson, G, Gulcher, JR, Haraldsson, M, Fossdal, R, Thorgeirsson, TE, Thorsteinsdottir, U, Ruggeri, M, Tosato, S, Franke, B, Strengman, E, Kiemeney, LA, Genetic Risk and Outcome in Psychosis (GROUP), , Melle, I, Djurovic, S, Abramova, L, Kaleda, V, Sanjuan, J, de Frutos, R, Bramon, E, Vassos, E, Fraser, G, Ettinger, U, Picchioni, M, Walker, N, Toulopoulou, T, Need, AC, Ge, D, Yoon, JL, Shianna, KV, Freimer, NB, Cantor, RM, Murray, R, Kong, A, Golimbet, V, Carracedo, A, Arango, C, Costas, J, JÃ¶nsson, EG, Terenius, L, Agartz, I, Petursson, H, NÃ¶then, MM, Rietschel, M, Matthews, PM, Muglia, P, Peltonen, L, St Clair, D, Goldstein, DB, Stefansson, K, & Collier, DA.

Although trials such as CATIE present important opportunities for pharmacogenetics research, the very richness of the clinical data presents challenges for statistical interpretation, and in particular the risk that data mining will lead to false-positive discoveries. For this reason, it is both misleading and unhelpful to perpetuate the current practice of reporting association results for these trials one gene at a time, ignoring the fact that multiple gene-by-phenotype tests are being carried out on the same data set. On the other hand, suggestive associations in such trials may lead to new hypotheses that can be tested through both replication efforts and biological experimentation. The appropriate handling of these forms of data therefore requires dissemination of association statistics without undue emphasis on select findings. Here we attempt to illustrate this approach by presenting association statistics for 2769 polymorphisms in 118 candidate genes evaluated for 21 pharmacogenetic phenotypes. On current evidence it is impossible to know which of these associations may be real, although in total they form a valuable resource that is immediately available to the scientific community.","pmid":"19156168","apaCitation":"Need, AC, Keefe, RS, Ge, D, Grossman, I, Dickson, S, McEvoy, JP, & Goldstein, DB.

The only known genetic risk factor is severe deficiency of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, which is present in 1-2% of individuals with COPD. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a homogenous case-control cohort from Bergen, Norway (823 COPD cases and 810 smoking controls) and evaluated the top 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the family-based International COPD Genetics Network (ICGN; 1891 Caucasian individuals from 606 pedigrees) study. The polymorphisms that showed replication were further evaluated in 389 subjects from the US National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) and 472 controls from the Normative Aging Study (NAS) and then in a fourth cohort of 949 individuals from 127 extended pedigrees from the Boston Early-Onset COPD population. Logistic regression models with adjustments of covariates were used to analyze the case-control populations. Family-based association analyses were conducted for a diagnosis of COPD and lung function in the family populations. Two SNPs at the alpha-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA 3/5) locus were identified in the genome-wide association study. They showed unambiguous replication in the ICGN family-based analysis and in the NETT case-control analysis with combined p-values of 1.48 x 10(-10), (rs8034191) and 5.74 x 10(-10) (rs1051730). Furthermore, these SNPs were significantly associated with lung function in both the ICGN and Boston Early-Onset COPD populations. The C allele of the rs8034191 SNP was estimated to have a population attributable risk for COPD of 12.2%. The association of hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) locus on chromosome 4 was also consistently replicated, but did not reach genome-wide significance levels. Genome-wide significant association of the HHIP locus with lung function was identified in the Framingham Heart study (Wilk et al., companion article in this issue of PLoS Genetics; doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000429). The CHRNA 3/5 and the HHIP loci make a significant contribution to the risk of COPD.

We investigated SNPs using 871 patients and 863 controls, following up the top hits in four independent cohorts comprising 1,460 patients and 12,995 controls, all of European origin. We found no genome-wide significant associations, nor could we provide support for any previously reported candidate gene or genome-wide associations. We went on to examine CNVs using a subset of 1,013 cases and 1,084 controls of European ancestry, and a further set of 60 cases and 64 controls of African ancestry. We found that eight cases and zero controls carried deletions greater than 2 Mb, of which two, at 8p22 and 16p13.11-p12.4, are newly reported here. A further evaluation of 1,378 controls identified no deletions greater than 2 Mb, suggesting a high prior probability of disease involvement when such deletions are observed in cases. We also provide further evidence for some smaller, previously reported, schizophrenia-associated CNVs, such as those in NRXN1 and APBA2. We could not provide strong support for the hypothesis that schizophrenia patients have a significantly greater \"load\" of large (>100 kb), rare CNVs, nor could we find common CNVs that associate with schizophrenia. Finally, we did not provide support for the suggestion that schizophrenia-associated CNVs may preferentially disrupt genes in neurodevelopmental pathways. Collectively, these analyses provide the first integrated study of SNPs and CNVs in schizophrenia and support the emerging view that rare deleterious variants may be more important in schizophrenia predisposition than common polymorphisms. While our analyses do not suggest that implicated CNVs impinge on particular key pathways, we do support the contribution of specific genomic regions in schizophrenia, presumably due to recurrent mutation. On balance, these data suggest that very few schizophrenia patients share identical genomic causation, potentially complicating efforts to personalize treatment regimens.","pmid":"19197363","apaCitation":"Need, AC, Ge, D, Weale, ME, Maia, J, Feng, S, Heinzen, EL, Shianna, KV, Yoon, W, KasperaviciÅ«te, D, Gennarelli, M, Strittmatter, WJ, Bonvicini, C, Rossi, G, Jayathilake, K, Cola, PA, McEvoy, JP, Keefe, RS, Fisher, EM, St Jean, PL, Giegling, I, Hartmann, AM, MÃ¶ller, HJ, Ruppert, A, Fraser, G, Crombie, C, Middleton, LT, St Clair, D, Roses, AD, Muglia, P, Francks, C, Rujescu, D, Meltzer, HY, & Goldstein, DB.

Identifying genetic variants that influence response to LEV may allow more tailored use of LEV. Obvious candidate genes are SV2A, SV2B and SV2C, which encode the only known binding site, synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2), with LEV binding to the SV2A isoform. SV2A is an essential protein as homozygous SV2A knockout mice appear normal at birth but fail to grow, experience severe seizures and die by 3 weeks. We addressed characterising AED response issues in pharmacogenetics and whether variation in these genes associates with response to LEV in two independent cohorts with epilepsy. We also investigated whether variation in these three genes associated with epilepsy predisposition in two larger cohorts of patients with various epilepsy phenotypes. Common genetic variation in SV2A, encoding the actual binding site of LEV, was fully represented in this study whereas SV2B and SV2C were not fully covered. None of the polymorphisms tested in SV2A, SV2B or SV2C influence LEV response or predisposition to epilepsy. We found no association between genetic variation in SV2A, SV2B or SV2C and response to LEV or epilepsy predisposition. We suggest this study design may be used in future pharmacogenetic work examining AED or LEV efficacy. However, different study designs would be needed to examine common variation with minor effect sizes, or rare variation, influencing AED or LEV response or epilepsy predisposition.

Despite this work, the relevance of specific polymorphisms to in vivo expression and splicing remains unclear. We carried out the first genome-wide screen, to our knowledge, for SNPs that associate with alternative splicing and gene expression in human primary cells, evaluating 93 autopsy-collected cortical brain tissue samples with no defined neuropsychiatric condition and 80 peripheral blood mononucleated cell samples collected from living healthy donors. We identified 23 high confidence associations with total expression and 80 with alternative splicing as reflected by expression levels of specific exons. Fewer than 50% of the implicated SNPs however show effects in both tissue types, reflecting strong evidence for distinct genetic control of splicing and expression in the two tissue types. The data generated here also suggest the possibility that splicing effects may be responsible for up to 13 out of 84 reported genome-wide significant associations with human traits. These results emphasize the importance of establishing a database of polymorphisms affecting splicing and expression in primary tissue types and suggest that splicing effects may be of more phenotypic significance than overall gene expression changes.","pmid":"19222302","apaCitation":"Heinzen, EL, Ge, D, Cronin, KD, Maia, JM, Shianna, KV, Gabriel, WN, Welsh-Bohmer, KA, Hulette, CM, Denny, TN, & Goldstein, DB.

Thus, rare variants may account for a larger fraction of the overall genetic risk than previously assumed. In contrast to rare single nucleotide mutations, rare copy number variations (CNVs) can be detected using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. This has led to the identification of CNVs associated with mental retardation and autism. In a genome-wide search for CNVs associating with schizophrenia, we used a population-based sample to identify de novo CNVs by analysing 9,878 transmissions from parents to offspring. The 66 de novo CNVs identified were tested for association in a sample of 1,433 schizophrenia cases and 33,250 controls. Three deletions at 1q21.1, 15q11.2 and 15q13.3 showing nominal association with schizophrenia in the first sample (phase I) were followed up in a second sample of 3,285 cases and 7,951 controls (phase II). All three deletions significantly associate with schizophrenia and related psychoses in the combined sample. The identification of these rare, recurrent risk variants, having occurred independently in multiple founders and being subject to negative selection, is important in itself. CNV analysis may also point the way to the identification of additional and more prevalent risk variants in genes and pathways involved in schizophrenia.","pmid":"18668039","apaCitation":"Stefansson, H, Rujescu, D, Cichon, S, PietilÃ¤inen, OP, Ingason, A, Steinberg, S, Fossdal, R, Sigurdsson, E, Sigmundsson, T, Buizer-Voskamp, JE, Hansen, T, Jakobsen, KD, Muglia, P, Francks, C, Matthews, PM, Gylfason, A, Halldorsson, BV, Gudbjartsson, D, Thorgeirsson, TE, Sigurdsson, A, Jonasdottir, A, Jonasdottir, A, Bjornsson, A, Mattiasdottir, S, Blondal, T, Haraldsson, M, Magnusdottir, BB, Giegling, I, MÃ¶ller, HJ, Hartmann, A, Shianna, KV, Ge, D, Need, AC, Crombie, C, Fraser, G, Walker, N, Lonnqvist, J, Suvisaari, J, Tuulio-Henriksson, A, Paunio, T, Toulopoulou, T, Bramon, E, Di Forti, M, Murray, R, Ruggeri, M, Vassos, E, Tosato, S, Walshe, M, Li, T, Vasilescu, C, MÃ¼hleisen, TW, Wang, AG, Ullum, H, Djurovic, S, Melle, I, Olesen, J, Kiemeney, LA, Franke, B, GROUP, , Sabatti, C, Freimer, NB, Gulcher, JR, Thorsteinsdottir, U, Kong, A, Andreassen, OA, Ophoff, RA, Georgi, A, Rietschel, M, Werge, T, Petursson, H, Goldstein, DB, NÃ¶then, MM, Peltonen, L, Collier, DA, St Clair, D, & Stefansson, K.

The easily interpretable diagrams can then be used to identify the associations that seem most likely to be biologically relevant, and to select genomic regions that may need to be resequenced in a search for candidate causal variants.

Where did they come from? What is the connection between an ancient Jewish priest in Jerusalem and today's Israeli sunbather on the beaches of Tel Aviv? These questions stand at the heart of this engaging book. Geneticist David Goldstein analyzes modern DNA studies of Jewish populations and examines the intersections of these scientific findings with the history (both biblical and modern) and oral tradition of the Jews. With a special gift for translating complex scientific concepts into language understandable to all, Goldstein delivers an accessible, personal, and fascinating book that tells the history of a group of people through the lens of genetics. In a series of detective-style stories, Goldstein explores the priestly lineage of Jewish males as manifested by Y chromosomes; the Jewish lineage claims of the Lemba, an obscure black South African tribe; the differences in maternal and paternal genetic heritage among Jewish populations; and much more. The author also grapples with the medical and ethical implications of our rapidly growing command of the human genomic landscape. The study of genetics has not only changed the study of Jewish history, Goldstein shows, it has altered notions of Jewish identity and even our understanding of what makes a people a people.

Despite this work, the relevance of specific polymorphisms to in vivo expression and splicing remains unclear. We carried out the first genome-wide screen, to our knowledge, for SNPs that associate with alternative splicing and gene expression in human primary cells, evaluating 93 autopsy-collected cortical brain tissue samples with no defined neuropsychiatric condition and 80 peripheral blood mononucleated cell samples collected from living healthy donors. We identified 23 high confidence associations with total expression and 80 with alternative splicing as reflected by expression levels of specific exons. Fewer than 50% of the implicated SNPs however show effects in both tissue types, reflecting strong evidence for distinct genetic control of splicing and expression in the two tissue types. The data generated here also suggest the possibility that splicing effects may be responsible for up to 13 out of 84 reported genome-wide significant associations with human traits. These results emphasize the importance of establishing a database of polymorphisms affecting splicing and expression in primary tissue types and suggest that splicing effects may be of more phenotypic significance than overall gene expression changes.

Materials & Methods: Unrelated healthy Tuvinians, Buryats, Altaians, Yakuts and Russians (n = 87-88) were genotyped for CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6. Standard pairwise genetic distances, locus-specific and global Fst statistics were calculated. Results: CYP allele and genotype frequencies demonstrated significant variability. Overall, the degree of between-population variance displayed by CYP SNPs was lower than that recorded from neutral short tandem repeats and Aluinsertion polymorphism, indicating evolutionary conservation of CYP polymorphisms. CYP-based genetic distances were well correlated with the geographic distances across populations (r = 0.822, p = 0.008). Conclusions: Although the tested variants were present in the neighboring, yet secluded, populations at the expected range of frequencies, the observed frequencies were significantly variable across Eurasian populations, indicating potential relevance to clinical decision making.

A growing body of research suggests that variations in gene transcript levels may contribute to the onset and progression of disease. Identifying how the regulation of gene expression may affect AD requires the use of high-quality mRNA from banked human brains. The present study was conducted to establish the quality and suitability of available banked brain tissue for future gene expression studies. We chose 32 AD cases with Braak stage IV, V, or VI. These AD cases were matched to 36 normal control cases by age and sex when possible. Multiple regions from each brain were sampled, including frontal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, and cerebellum. Hippocampus was also available for study from 14 control cases. A comparison of several antemortem and postmortem variables, such as postmortem interval, agonal state, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid pH, and cause of death were analyzed. RNA was isolated from at least 1 area from every brain and most brains yielded intact RNA from all regions tested. Analysis of the clinical variables did not reveal any features that correlated with the ability to recover intact mRNA. We conclude that undegraded mRNA may be isolated from most brain regions many hours postmortem and that neither the pH of ventricular fluid nor postmortem interval is predictive of mRNA integrity.","pmid":"18090918","apaCitation":"Ervin, JF, Heinzen, EL, Cronin, KD, Goldstein, D, Szymanski, MH, Burke, JR, Welsh-Bohmer, KA, & Hulette, CM.

Evidence from in vitro transfection studies is often assumed to be sufficient evidence for the in vivo functional importance of a polymorphism in the context of human disease, even though many confounding effects (e.g. temporal regulation, tissue specificity, genetic background) are not considered. In this study, we evaluate this assumption directly by examining the translation of in vitro results on allele-specific expression to an in vivo system using four genes that have been well documented through reporter assays to have promoter polymorphisms affecting transcription level: monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), neuropeptide Y (NPY), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and prodynorphin (PDYN). In our study, MAOA was found to have large allelic imbalances, which indicates that there is in vivo variation in the expression of this gene. However, the imbalances observed were not correlated with genotype at the putatively functional polymorphism. PDYN, NOS3 and NPY did not have large allelic imbalances. Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of these polymorphisms on expression level as measured by imbalance ratios in any of these genes. These results suggest that the functional effects of a polymorphism on gene expression may be more complicated and context dependent than is often assumed and also imply that the use of cell-based expression studies to support the role of such polymorphisms in disease etiology should be treated with caution.","pmid":"17566082","apaCitation":"Cirulli, ET, & Goldstein, DB.

This study sought to characterize the functional effects of this polymorphism on alternative splicing of SCN1A and to explore the potential for modulating the drug response in the pharmacologically unfavorable genotype by identification of a splice modifier acting on SCN1A. The effects of the genotype at the SCN1A IVS5N+5 G-->A polymorphism on SCN1A splice-variant proportions and the consequences of increased expression of splice modifiers were investigated both in human temporal neocortex tissue and in a cellular minigene expression system. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the amounts of SCN1A transcripts forms. We show that the polymorphism has a dramatic effect on the proportions of neonate and adult alternative transcripts of SCN1A in adult brain tissue and that the effect of the polymorphism also appears to be modified by Nova2 expression levels. A minigene expression system confirms both the effect of the polymorphism on transcript proportions and the role of Nova2 in the regulation of splicing, with higher Nova2 expression increasing the proportion of the neonate form. A larger Nova2-mediated effect was detected in the AA genotype that is associated with increased dose requirements. The effects of Nova2 on modulation of the alternative splicing of 17 other neuronally expressed genes were investigated, and no effect was observed. These findings emphasize the emerging role of genetic polymorphisms in modulation of drug effect and illustrate both alternative splicing as a potential therapeutic target and the importance of considering the activity of compounds at alternative splice forms of drug targets in screening programs.","pmid":"17436242","apaCitation":"Heinzen, EL, Yoon, W, Tate, SK, Sen, A, Wood, NW, Sisodiya, SM, & Goldstein, DB.

However, even when these factors are taken into account, considerable variation remains unexplained and could potentially be attributable to genetic differences between patients. Drug response may be dictated by variation in genes involved in both pharmacokinetic (PK) (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion [ADME]) and pharmacodynamic (PD) (receptors, ion channels, enzymes, immune system) pathways. Functional variants of the ADME genes can result in patients being poor, intermediate, efficient, or ultrarapid metabolizers of specific agents, thereby affecting efficacy and/or susceptibility to adverse drug reaction and necessitating individualized dosing. A well-documented example of ADME gene variation is the debrisoquine polymorphism, which is characterized by markedly different metabolism of numerous commonly prescribed drugs based on variants of the cytochrome P450 2D6 gene. Variants of genes regulating PD pathways cause altering of drug target pathways, which may affect efficacy in a more pronounced manner. Examples of gene variants affecting PD pathways include those coding for dopamine metabolism, synthesis, and transport. These gene variants may act independently, in combination with each other, and/or in combination with PK genes to affect drug response, for example to antipsychotic medications. Increased understanding of a patient's genotype and its corresponding effect on drug response would be useful to the practicing clinician in choosing an effective drug and in optimizing the dose in a timely manner.","pmid":"17403378","apaCitation":"Goldstein, DB, Need, AC, Singh, R, & Sisodiya, SM.

The transporter best studied is P-glycoprotein, an ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily member. RLIP76 is suggested to be an energy-dependent non-ABC transporter, reducing AED blood-brain barrier penetration, with a more important role than P-glycoprotein. Knowledge of which transporters may be critical in drug resistance is important for design of potential therapies. We tested the hypothesis that RLIP76 mediates AED resistance using methods complementary to those in the original report. Methods: Double-labeling fluorescent immunohistochemistry localized RLIP76 expression. Population genetics was used to explore association of variation in the RLIP76-encoding gene with drug-response and epilepsy phenotypes. Comparative protein structure modeling and bioinformatic annotation were used to predict RLIP76 structure and features. Results: In normal and epileptogenic brain tissue, immunoreactivity for RLIP76 was cytoplasmic, with colocalization with a neuronal, but not an endothelial, marker. Genotyping of six tagging SNPs, representing common genetic variation in RLIP76, in patients with epilepsy responsive (n = 262) or resistant (n = 107) to AEDs showed no association with phenotype at any level. RLIP76 genotypic and haplotypic frequencies in 783 patients with epilepsy and 359 healthy controls showed no association with epilepsy susceptibility. RLIP76 is not predicted to have transmembrane localization or ATPase activity. Conclusions: No support for RLIP76 itself in directly mediating resistance to AEDs nor in increasing susceptibility to epilepsy was found. More evidence is required before either a role for RLIP76 in drug resistance can be accepted or focus directed away from other transporters, such as P-glycoprotein.

It has recently been suggested that variation in the BRD2 gene confers increased risk of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), which accounts for around a quarter of all IGE. Here we examine the association between the candidate causal SNP (the promoter variant rs3918149) and JME in five independent cohorts comprising in total 531 JME cases and 1,390 healthy controls. Methods: The strongest candidate causal variant from the original report (rs3918149) was genotyped across all five cohorts. In an effort to identify novel candidate causal polymorphisms, previously unscreened regions of UTR were resequenced. Results: We observed a significant effect in a small sample recruited in Britain (genotype p = 0.001, allele p = 0.001), a borderline significant effect in a sample recruited in Ireland and no association in larger samples of German, Australian, and Indian populations. There was no association with other common forms of epilepsy or any other clear candidate casual variants in or near the BRD2 region. Conclusions: The replication of an effect in the British cohort and suggestive evidence from that recruited in Ireland but lack of replication from the larger German, Australian, and Indian cohorts is surprising and difficult to explain. Further replication in carefully matched populations is required. Results presented here do not, however, support a strong effect for susceptibility to JME across populations of European descent.

Here we examine this question by: (1) attempting to replicate the original association, (2) assessing the association of other variants in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with C3435T, and (3) evaluating and comparing our findings with other published studies. We defined drug-responsiveness as seizure freedom or a 50% or more reduction in seizure frequency in the preceding year. Drug resistance was defined as a less than 50% reduction in seizure frequency in the preceding year. We used a combination of map-based (tagging SNPs) and direct sequence-based methods allowing a comprehensive assessment of variation across the associated interval. Genotypic data on 8 SNPs was collected on 440 patients, of whom 242 were drug-responsive and 198 were drug-resistant. We were unable to observe the original association of drug-resistant epilepsy with C3435T, nor any association with other functional variants at SNP or haplotype level in the ABCB1 gene. Evaluation of other attempted replication studies suggest that if the original C3435T association is indeed real, it would appear highly sensitive to the phenotype used. Alternatively, the discrepant results of this and other association attempts may be indicative of the original report of the CC genotype at C3435T in ABCB1 being a false positive finding. Variability in phenotypic descriptions in genetic association studies may partly explain the inconsistency of attempted replications.

For this reason a large number of studies have assessed the functional consequences of variation in this gene. Particular attention has focused on the ABCB1_3435C>T polymorphism, an exonic variant resulting in a synonymous change. This variant has been associated with mRNA, protein and serum levels, and with responses to a number of medicines. The results of association studies have, however, been variable and it is not currently clear whether this polymorphism is functional or is in linkage disequilibrium with functionally distinct alleles. RESULTS: To identify functional variation in the ABCB1 gene we assessed allelic imbalance by pyrosequencing cDNA from 80 lymphoblastoid B cell lines from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) collection, including 74 individuals heterozygous for 3435C>T. We found that the degree of ABCB1 allelic imbalance differed among B-cell lines. In an effort to fine-map variants that influence the proportion of the two allelic mRNA species we genotyped representative common variations near the 3435C>T polymorphism by using a tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach. In one approach, we assessed in segregating families the impact of cis-acting variants on mRNA levels by using allelic imbalance as the phenotype in a regression analysis that distinguishes the coupling arrangements (phase) among alleles. In a second approach, we assessed allelic imbalance levels in lymphoblastoid B-cell lines from unrelated HapMap individuals, and performed an association using tagSNPs in a 5-Mb region surrounding the gene. Two potential cis-acting variants, a promoter rs28656907/rs28373093 dinucleotide polymorphism (P=0.007) and the rs10245483 SNP (P=0.0003) located 2 Mb upstream from the gene, were predictors of ABCB1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The study outlines a general experimental approach for fine mapping gene variants that influence mRNA expression by using cultured cell lines.

Although a number of association studies have been performed in an effort to find genetic components of sporadic ALS, most of them resulted in inconsistent findings due to a small number of genes investigated in relatively small sample sizes, while the replication of results was rarely attempted. Defects in retrograde axonal transport, vesicle trafficking and xenobiotic metabolism have been implicated in neurodegeneration and motor neuron death both in human disease and animal models. To assess the role of common genetic variation in these pathways in susceptibility to sporadic ALS, we performed a pathway-based candidate gene case-control association study with replication. Furthermore, we determined reliability of whole genome amplified DNA in a large-scale association study. In the first stage of the study, 1277 putative functional and tagging SNPs in 134 genes spanning 8.7 Mb were genotyped in 822 British sporadic ALS patients and 872 controls using whole genome amplified DNA. To detect variants with modest effect size and discriminate among false positive findings 19 SNPs showing a trend of association in the initial screen were genotyped in a replication sample of 580 German sporadic ALS patients and 361 controls. We did not detect strong evidence of association with any of the genes investigated in the discovery sample (lowest uncorrected P-value 0.00037, lowest permutation corrected P-value 0.353). None of the suggestive associations was replicated in a second sample, further excluding variants with moderate effect size. We conclude that common variation in the investigated pathways is unlikely to have a major effect on susceptibility to sporadic ALS. The genotyping efficiency was only slightly decreased (â¼1%) and genotyping quality was not affected using whole genome amplified DNA. It is reliable for large scale genotyping studies of diseases such as ALS, where DNA sample collections are limited because of low disease prevalence and short survival time.

RIMS1 encodes a synapse active-zone protein with important roles in the maintenance of normal synaptic function: mice lacking this protein have greatly reduced learning ability and memory function. Objective: An established paradigm examining the structural and functional effects of mutations in genes expressed in the eye and the brain was used to study a kindred with an inherited retinal dystrophy due to RIMS1 mutation. Materials and methods: Neuropsychological tests and high-resolution MRI brain scanning were undertaken in the kindred. In a population cohort, neuropsychological scores were associated with common variation in RIMS1. Additionally, RIMS1 was sequenced in top-scoring individuals. Evolution of RIMS1 was assessed, and its expression in developing human brain was studied. Results: Affected individuals showed significantly enhanced cognitive abilities across a range of domains. Analysis suggests that factors other than RIMS1 mutation were unlikely to explain enhanced cognition. No association with common variation and verbal IQ was found in the population cohort, and no other mutations in RIMS1 were detected in the highest scoring individuals from this cohort. RIMS1 protein is expressed in developing human brain, but RIMS1 does not seem to have been subjected to accelerated evolution in man. Conclusions: A possible role for RIMS1 in the enhancement of cognitive function at least in this kindred is suggested. Although further work is clearly required to explore these findings before a role for RIMS1 in human cognition can be formally accepted, the findings suggest that genetic mutation may enhance human cognition in some cases.","pmid":"17237123","apaCitation":"Sisodiya, SM, Thompson, PJ, Need, A, Harris, SE, Weale, ME, Wilkie, SE, Michaelides, M, Free, SL, Walley, N, Gumbs, C, Gerrelli, D, Ruddle, P, Whalley, LJ, Starr, JM, Hunt, DM, Goldstein, DB, Deary, IJ, & Moore, AT.

Dopamine availability is controlled largely by three enzymes: COMT, MAOA and MAOB, and by the dopamine transporter SLC6A3, and each gene has a well-characterized functional variant. Here we look at these four functional polymorphisms together, to investigate how heritable variation in dopamine levels influences the risk of obesity in a cohort of 1150, including 240 defined as obese (BMI > or = 30). The COMT and SLC6A3 polymorphisms showed no association with either weight, BMI or obesity risk. We found, however, that both MAOA and MAOB show an excess of the low-activity genotypes in obese individuals (MAOA:chi2= 15.45, p = 0.004; MAOB:chi2= 8.05, p = 0.018). Additionally, the MAOA genotype was significantly associated with both weight (p = 0.0005) and BMI (p = 0.001). When considered together, the 'at risk genotype'--low activity genotypes at both the MAOA and MAOB loci--shows a relative risk for obesity of 5.01. These results have not been replicated and, given the experience of complex trait genetics, warrant caution in interpretation. In implicating both the MAOA and MOAB variants, however, this study provides the first indication that dopamine availability (as opposed to other effects of MAOA) is involved in human obesity. It is therefore a priority to assess the associations in replication datasets.","pmid":"16674552","apaCitation":"Need, AC, Ahmadi, KR, Spector, TD, & Goldstein, DB.

A common functional polymorphism in the SCN1A gene (one of the genes encoding the drug target) has been previously associated with maximum dose of phenytoin used clinically, and also maximum dose of carbamazepine, another antiepileptic drug with the same drug target. METHODS: We have related variation at the SCN1A IVS5-91 G>A polymorphism to maximum dose and to maintenance dose of phenytoin in 168 patients with epilepsy treated with phenytoin. We also related genotype to phenytoin serum levels at maximum dose and at maintenance dose of phenytoin. We genotyped the polymorphism using an Applied Biosystems Taqman assay. RESULTS: The polymorphism is associated with phenytoin serum concentration at maintenance dose (P=0.03). In a reduced cohort of 71 patients receiving phenytoin monotherapy this association is also significant (P=0.03). Neither association remains significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: These results are not a replication of the original study. They do, however, support the hypothesis that this polymorphism influences the clinical use of phenytoin. They also demonstrate the utility of using multiple phenotypes in pharmacogenetics studies, particularly when attempting to separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. As the SCN1A polymorphism affects phenytoin pharmacodynamics, it is particularly useful to obtain data on serum levels in addition to dose because association of a pharmacodynamic variant may be stronger with serum levels than dose as the serum level may eliminate or reduce pharmacokinetic variability.

Given the evidence suggesting an idiosyncratic drug response, we set out to detect genetic variation of strong, clinically relevant effect that might guide clinicians in the safe, controlled prescribing of this otherwise usefuldrug. Methods: Patients with a history of at least 1-year exposure to vigabatrin were enrolled at two independent referral centers. Using Goldmann perimetry, visual fields and the extent of constriction were calculated for each patient. We examined the correlation between the extent of vigabatrin induced visual field constriction and genetic variation across six candidate genes (SLC6A1, SLC6A13, SCL6A11, ABAT, GABRR1 and GABRR2). We availed of HapMap data and used a tagging SNP technique in an effort to efficiently capture all common variation within these genes. We attempted to replicate any positive associations before drawing conclusions from our results. Results: The degree of visual field constriction correlated with three SNPs and one haplotype in a cohort of 73 patients. However we were unable to replicate these findings in a second independent cohort consisting of 58 patients, suggesting the initial results were possibly false positives, or variants of weak effect. Conclusion: Common variants of strong, clinically relevant effect do not appear to reside in the candidate genes studied here. This does not rule out the presence of genetic variants of weak effect in these genes, nor of variants of strong effect in other genes. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here we set out to examine whether common variation in GABRG2 predisposes to the development of common, complex forms of epilepsy in two large independent cohorts. Methods: We have applied a tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (tSNP) technique allowing us to satisfactorily represent common variation in the gene. However, to ensure maximal representation of functional variation and in particular in cases of low minor allele frequency (MAF), we have identified and forced known functional variation as tagging SNPs. We examined the association between tagging SNPs and subtypes of epilepsy in two independent cohorts; the first consisted of 677 cases and 384 healthy controls, the second of 684 cases and 277 healthy controls. Results: We failed to detect any variation that conferred an increased risk of disease development in both cohorts. Discussion: Our results suggest that common variants of strong effect in GABRG2 do not appear to play a role in the development of common, complex forms of epilepsy. This report illustrates a number of important features of study design in genetic association studies, including the simultaneous use of map and sequence-based techniques and the necessity of replication before robust conclusions can be drawn from results.

The strongest evidence comes from a meta-analysis of small studies that reported the S18Y polymorphism as protective against PD, after pooling studies of white and Asian subjects. Here, we present data that challenge this association. Methods: In a new large case-control study in white individuals (3,023 subjects), the S18Y variant was not protective against PD under any genetic model of inheritance. Similarly, a more powerful haplotype-tagging approach did not detect other associated variants. Results: Finally, in an updated S18Y-PD meta-analysis (6,594 subjects), no significant association was observed under additive, recessive, or dominant models (odds ratio = 1.00 [95% confidence interval: 0.74-1.33]; odds ratio = 1.01 [95% confidence interval: 0.76-1.35]j and odds ratio = 0.96 [95% confidence interval: 0.86-1.08], respectively), and a cumulative meta-analysis showed a trend toward a null effect.

In addition, P-glycoprotein activity determines bioavailability of many drugs used regularly in many medical specialities, and ABCB/MDR1 variation appears to be a critical pharmacogenetic determinant. We have utilized a gene-wide haplotype tagging approach to further define the identity of germ-line variations in the ABCB1/MDR1 gene contributing to IBD susceptibility. Six haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) representing the haplotypic variations of the ABCB1/MDR1 gene were identified initially following the characterization of the haplotype structure of this gene in 24 Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain Caucasian trios. Genotyping was performed in 249 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 179 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 260 healthy controls. Using log-likelihood analysis, we observed a highly significant association between the common haplotypes and UC (P = 4.22 Ã 10-7) but not CD (P = 0.22). This significant association was critically dependent on one tSNP, intronic variant rs3789243. All haplotypes with this variant retained a highly significant association (P = 3.2 Ã 10-7 - 3.6 Ã 10-12), whereas significance was lost when rs3789243 was dropped in systematic haplotypic analysis. The effect of this tSNP was independent of C3435T SNP, previously suggested to be the critical variant in disease susceptibility and drug transport. The association with UC was shown to be strongest with the phenotype of extensive disease (P = 1.7 Ã 10-7). This 'candidate gene' approach provides compelling evidence to support the contribution of the ABCB1/MDR1 gene in determining risk to UC but not to CD and provides new insights into the localization of the critical susceptibility determinants within the gene. In addition, these findings have potentially important implications in the application of pharmacogenetics across a range of common diseases, including HIV, epilepsy and colorectal cancer.

Epilepsy is a common, serious, and treatable neurological disorder, yet current treatment is limited by high rates of adverse drug reactions and lack of complete seizure control in a significant proportion of patients. The disorder is especially suitable for pharmacogenetic investigation because treatment response can be quantified and side-effects can be assessed with validated measures. Additionally, there is substantial knowledge of the pharmacodynamics and kinetics of antiepileptic drugs, and some candidate genes implicated in the disorder have been identified. However, recent studies of the association of particular genes and their genetic variants with seizure control and adverse drug reactions have not provided unifying conclusions.

We also examine if these variants contribute to other types of epilepsy by examination in a larger cohort of 752 patients representing a range of different epilepsies. We fail to clearly replicate any of the previously reported associations and also fail to show a role for these variants in the development of other forms of epilepsy.

The G protein-coupled receptor encoded by TAS2R16 mediates response to salicin, amygdalin, and many bitter Î²- glucopyranosides. Î²-glucopyranosides are ubiquitous in nature, with many having a highly toxic cyanogenic activity. Results: We examined evidence for natural selection on the human receptor TAS2R16 by sequencing the entire coding region, as well as part of the 5â² and 3â² UTRs, in 997 individuals from 60 human populations. We detected signatures of positive selection, indicated by an excess of evolutionarily derived alleles at the nonsynonymous site K172N and two linked sites and significant values of Fay and Wu's H statistics in 19 populations. The estimated age range for the common ancestor of the derived N172 variant is 78,700-791,000 years, placing it in the Middle Pleistocene and before the expansion of early humans out of Africa. Using calcium imaging in cells expressing different receptor variants, we showed that N172 is associated with an increased sensitivity to salicin, arbutin, and five different cyanogenic glycosides. Conclusion: We have detected a clear signal of positive selection at the bitter-taste receptor gene TAS2R16. We speculate that the increased sensitivity that is shown toward harmful cyanogenic glycosides and conferred by the N172 allele may have driven the signal of selection at an early stage of human evolution.

Independent lines of phylogenetic and population genetic evidence support a history of selective sweeps driving the evolution of the human prodynorphin promoter. In experimental assays of chimpanzee-human hybrid promoters, the selected sequence increases transcriptional inducibility. The evidence for a change in the response of the brain's natural opioids to inductive stimuli points to potential human-specific characteristics favored during evolution. In addition, the pattern of linked nucleotide and microsatellite variation among and within modern human populations suggests that recent selection, subsequent to the fixation of the human-specific mutations and the peopling of the globe, has favored different prodynorphin cis-regulatory alleles in different parts of the world.","apaCitation":"Rockman, MV, Hahn, MW, Soranzo, N, Zimprich, F, Goldstein, DB, & Wray, GA.

Through various initiatives, the FDA is encouraging drug developers to apply the rapidly evolving pharmacogenomic tools and integrate these data into the evaluation of patient variability. The FDA has clarified when these data are required submissions and when they are exploratory data that can be shared via a newly established process (voluntary genomic submission). Increasingly, pharmacogenetics and genomic information are being included in drug labeling before market approval (eg, trastuzumab [Herceptin; Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, Calif], atomoxetine [Strattera], and voriconazole [Vfend]) or after approval, when new information becomes available (eg, thioridazine [Mellaril], 6-mercaptopurine [Purinethol], and irinotecan [Camptosar]), so that health care providers and patients have updated information on how genomics, along with other factors (age, gender, hepatic, renal impairment, concomitant medications, and others), can influence individual responses. Various genomic tests are being developed for use with the previously mentioned or other drug products. For example, a recently approved chip provides genotyping of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Another test was approved to provide genotyping of UGT1A1. There are many challenges to the effective translation of pharmacogenomic information to clinical practice, and they need to be addressed before the full potential of pharmacogenomics to optimize patient therapy can be realized. This commentary addresses one of the critical issues in the collection of pharmacogenomic data. Defining what basic polymorphic alleles to evaluate in various ethnic or racial groups is important for common, known valid metabolic biomarkers such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1 (Table III). It is also timely to discuss emerging data for exploratory biomarkers (eg, CYP3A4/3A5, ABCB1, or methods involving tagging SNPs) because their correlations with clinical response have been increasingly evaluated during drug development. Other clear challenges include the following: education of health care providers and patients, insurance coverage of pharmacogenomic tests, the availability of robust and valid tests, and the need for an interdisciplinary counseling team approach to address complex issues with individual patients. Many individuals and organizations are working to remove these barriers to full use of pharmacogenomics to improve public health.

Genetic polymorphism in these genes may be associated with changes in transport function. Methods: A comprehensive evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (39 SNPs in ABCB1, 7 in ABCC1, 27 in ABCC2, and 16 in ABCG2), and inferred haplotypes was done to assess possible associations of genetic variants with cellular exposure of nelfinavir in vivo. Analysis used peripheral mononuclear cells from individuals receiving nelfinavir (n = 28). Key results were re-examined in a larger sample size (n = 129) contributing data on plasma drug levels.

The cause is unknown but over the past few years tremendous progress in our understanding of the genetic bases of this condition has been made. To date, this has almost exclusively come from the study of relatively rare Mendelian forms of the disease and there are no currently, widely accepted common variants known to increase susceptibility. The role that the 'Mendelian' genes play in common sporadic forms of PD is unknown. Moreover, most studies in PD can really be described as candidate polymorphism studies rather than true and complete assessments of the genes themselves. We provide a model of how one might tackle some of these issues using Parkinson's disease as an illustration. One of the emerging hypotheses of gene environment interaction in Parkinson's disease is based on drug metabolizing (or xenobiotic) enzymes and their interaction with putative environmental toxins. This motivated us to describe a tagging approach for an extensive but not exhaustive list of 55 drug metabolizing enzyme genes. We use these data to illustrate the power, and some of the limitations of a haplotype tagging approach. We show that haplotype tagging is extremely efficient and works well with only a modest increase in effort through different populations. The tagging approach works much less well if the minor allele frequency is below 5%.

Studying the genetics of drug resistance in epilepsy is important, as it may identify or confirm key mechanisms underlying this phenomenon that have real clinical importance; it might also offer insights into its prediction and management. Drug resistance in epilepsy is likely to be multifactorial: overactivity of multi-drug transporters provides one likely underlying mechanism through lowering of AED concentration in the epileptogenic focus. Genetic association studies may provide a tool to assess this 'transporter' hypothesis by determining whether differences between individuals contribute to resistance phenotypes. Most of these studies have investigated one variant in the ABCB1 gene, and have provided, thus far, inconclusive evidence. This review also considers current knowledge of the role of genetic polymorphisms in multi-drug transporters in pharmacoresistant epilepsy, to highlight possible confounding factors affecting the implementation and interpretation of association studies in this field.

As with many AEDs, a broad range of doses is used, with the final \"maintenance\" dose normally determined by trial and error. Although many genes could influence response to these medicines, there are obvious candidates. Both drugs target the Î±-subunit of the sodium channel, encoded by the SCN family of genes. Phenytoin is principally metabolized by CYP2C9, and both are probable substrates of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein. We therefore assessed whether variation in these genes associates with the clinical use of carbamazepine and phenytoin in cohorts of 425 and 281 patients, respectively. We report that a known functional polymorphism in CYP2C9 is highly associated with the maximum dose of phenytoin (P = 0.0066). We also show that an intronic polymorphism in the SCN1A gene shows significant association with maximum doses in regular usage of both carbamazepine and phenytoin (P = 0.0051 and P = 0.014, respectively). This polymorphism disrupts the consensus sequence of the 5â² splice donor site of a highly conserved alternative exon (5N), and it significantly affects the proportions of the alternative transcripts in individuals with a history of epilepsy. These results provide evidence of a drug target polymorphism associated with the clinical use of AEDs and set the stage for a prospective evaluation of how pharmacogenetic diagnostics can be used to improve dosing decisions in the use of phenytoin and carbamazepine. Although the case made here is compelling, our results cannot be considered definitive or ready for clinical application until they are confirmed by independent replication.

Detailed analyses of 754 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in two population samples (European and Japanese) provide a set of haplotype tagging SNPs that economically represent variation in most of the major enzymes that act on prescription drugs. I use these analyses to address a number of outstanding questions relating to haplotype mapping.

Four common polymorphisms in the 5' promoter region of factor VII (F7), a coagulation factor, have been shown to affect its transcription and protein abundance both in vitro and in vivo. Three of these polymorphisms have low-frequency alleles that decrease expression of F7 and may provide protection against myocardial infarction (heart attacks). The fourth polymorphism has a minor allele that increases the level of transcription. To look for evidence of natural selection on the cis-regulatory variants flanking F7, we genotyped three of the polymorphisms in six Old World populations for which we also have data from a group of putatively neutral SNPs. Our population genetic analysis shows evidence for selection within humans; surprisingly, the strongest evidence is due to a large increase in frequency of the high-expression variant in Singaporean Chinese. Further characterization of a Japanese population shows that at least part of the increase in frequency of the high-expression allele is found in other East Asian populations. In addition, to examine interspecific patterns of selection we sequenced the homologous 5' noncoding region in chimpanzees, bonobos, a gorilla, an orangutan, and a baboon. Analysis of these data reveals an excess of fixed differences within transcription factor binding sites along the human lineage. Our results thus further support the hypothesis that regulatory mutations have been important in human evolution.","pmid":"15238535","apaCitation":"Hahn, MW, Rockman, MV, Soranzo, N, Goldstein, DB, & Wray, GA.

One recent example is the 3435C>T polymorphism in the multidrug transporter gene ABCB1, associated with protein expression and activity, and with several clinical conditions. Available data suggest that 3435C>T may not directly cause altered transport activity, but may be associated with one or more causal variants in the poorly characterized stretch of linkage disequilibrium (LD) surrounding it. Here we describe a strategy for the follow-up of reported associations, including a Bayesian formalization of the associated interval concept previously described by Goldstein. We focus on the region of high LD around 3435C>T to compile an exhaustive list of variants by (1) using a relatively coarse set of marker typings to assess the pattern of LD, and (2) resequencing derived and ancestral chromosomes at 343SC>T through the associated interval. We identified three intronic sites that are strongly associated with the 3435C>T polymorphism. One of them is associated with multidrug resistance in patients with epilepsy (Ï2 = 3.78, P = 0.052), and sits within a stretch of significant evolutionary conservation. We argue that these variants represent additional candidates for influencing multidrug resistance due to P-glycoprotein activity, with the IVS 26+80 T>C being the best candidate among the three intronic sites. Finally, we describe a set of six haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms that represent common ABCB1 variation surrounding 3435C>T in Europeans.

We determined that the NFAT binding site is unique to humans; it arose by point mutation along the lineage separating humans from other great apes. We show that its frequency distribution among human subpopulations has been shaped by the balance of selective forces on IL4's diverse roles. New statistical approaches, based on parametric and nonparametric comparisons to neutral variants typed in the same individuals, indicate that differentiation among subpopulations at the IL4 promoter polymorphism is too great to be attributed to neutral drift. The allele frequencies of this binding site represent local adaptation to diverse pathogenic challenges; disease states associated with the common derived allele are side-effects of positive selection on other IL4 functions.","pmid":"14654003","apaCitation":"Rockman, MV, Hahn, MW, Soranzo, N, Goldstein, DB, & Wray, GA.

Considerable interest has therefore recently focused on the development of methods that efficiently screen genomic regions or whole genomes for gene variants associated with complex phenotypes. One key element in this search is the use of linkage disequilibrium to gain maximal information from typing a selected subset of highly informative single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, now often called \"tagging SNPs\" (tSNPs). Probably the most common approach to linkage-disequilibrium gene mapping involves a three-step program: (1) characterization of the haplotype structure in candidate genes or genomic regions of interest, (2) identification of tSNPs sufficient to represent the most common haplotypes, and (3) typing of tSNPs in clinical material. Early definitions of tSNPs focused on the amount of haplotype diversity that they explained. To select tSNPs that would have maximal power in a genetic association study, however, we have developed optimization criteria based on the r2 measure of association and have compared these with other criteria based on the haplotype diversity. To evaluate the full program and to assess how well the selected tags are likely to perform, we have determined the haplotype structure and have assessed tSNPs in the SCN1A gene, an important candidate gene for sporadic epilepsy. We find that as few as four tSNPs are predicted to maintain a consistently high r2 value with all other common SNPs in the gene, indicating that the tags could be used in an association study with only a modest reduction in power relative to direct assays of all common SNPs. This implies that very large case-control studies can be screened for variation in hundreds of candidate genes with manageable experimental effort, once tSNPs are identified. However, our results also show that tSNPs identified in one population may not necessarily perform well in another, indicating that the preliminary study to identify tSNPs and the later case-control study should be performed in the same population. Our results also indicate that tSNPs will not easily identify discrepant SNPs, which lie on importantly discriminating but apparently short genealogical branches. This could significantly complicate tagging approaches for phenotypes influenced by variants that have experienced positive selection.","apaCitation":"Weale, ME, Depondt, C, Macdonald, SJ, Smith, A, Lai, PS, Shorvon, SD, Wood, NW, & Goldstein, DB.

Recent work has demonstrated that comparisons of genetic variation in the British Isles and on the European Continent can illuminate specific demographic processes in the history of the British Isles. For example, Wilson et al. [4] used the similarity of Basque and Celtic Y chromosomes to argue for genetic continuity from the Upper Palaeolithic to the present in the paternal history of these populations (see also [5]). Differences in the Y chromosome composition of these groups also suggested genetic signatures of Norwegian influence in the Orkney Islands north of the Scottish mainland, an important center of Viking activities between 800 and 1300 A.D. [6]. More recently, Weale et al. [7] argued for substantial Anglo-Saxon male migration into central England based on the analysis of eight British sample sets collected on an east-west transect across England and Wales. To provide a more complete assessment of the paternal genetic history of the British Isles, we have compared the Y chromosome composition of multiple geographically distant British sample sets with collections from Norway (two sites), Denmark, and Germany and with collections from central Ireland, representing, respectively, the putative invading and the indigenous populations. By analyzing 1772 Y chromosomes from 25 predominantly small urban locations, we found that different parts of the British Isles have sharply different paternal histories; the degree of population replacement and genetic continuity shows systematic variation across the sampled areas.","apaCitation":"Capelli, C, Redhead, N, Abernethy, JK, Gratrix, F, Wilson, JF, Moen, T, Hervig, T, Richards, M, Stumpf, MPH, Underhill, PA, Bradshaw, P, Shaha, A, Thomas, MG, Bradman, N, & Goldstein, DB.

Because this form is resistant to multiple antiepileptic drugs, the mode of resistance must be non-specific, involving drug-efflux transporters such as ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1, also known as MDR1 and P-glycoprotein 170). We hypothesized that the CC genotype at the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism, which is associated with increased expression of the protein, influences the response to antiepileptic-drug treatment. METHODS: ABCB1 3435 was genotyped in 315 patients with epilepsy, classified as drug-resistant in 200 and drug-responsive in 115, and 200 control subjects without epilepsy. Recently devised methods were used to control for population stratification, and linkage disequilibrium was calculated across the gene. RESULTS: As compared with patients with drug-responsive epilepsy, patients with drug-resistant epilepsy were more likely to have the CC genotype at ABCB1 3435 than the TT genotype (odds ratio, 2.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.32 to 5.38; P=0.006). There was no genetic stratification between the two groups of patients. The polymorphism fell within an extensive block of linkage disequilibrium spanning much or all of the gene, implying that the polymorphism may not itself be causal but rather may be linked with the causal variant.

It has been recently suggested that linkage disequilibrium in humans may be organized in a block-like structure, with islands of high LD separated by regions of rapid breakdown of LD due to recombination hotspots [1-3]. The experimental data to date, however, are limited, and fundamental questions remain about the implications of recombination rate heterogeneity. Here, we use computer simulations to evaluate how such heterogeneity influences patterns of LD, and we develop formal criteria to assess whether the patterns are functionally block like in the context of association mapping. Results: Our analyses suggest that, even in models of extreme recombination rate heterogeneity, some human populations will have a functionally block-like structure to the pattern of LD, but others will not, depending on their precise demographic histories. In fact, for many models, we find that, following an LD-generating event, populations may move through discrete phases that can be functionally described as pre-block, block, and post-block. An analysis of observed and expected patterns of LD surrounding hotspots within the MHC Class II region confirms these theoretical expectations. Conclusions: Even if highly punctuated patterns of recombination are the rule, patterns of LD are still likely to show differences among populations and among genomic regions that are of practical importance in the design of genetic association studies. The notion that the average extent of LD is a useful concept for the design of association studies must be abandoned in light of the experimental and theoretical evidence.","apaCitation":"Stumpf, MPH, & Goldstein, DB.

The results suggest that most Jewish communities were founded by relatively few women, that the founding process was independent in different geographic areas, and that subsequent genetic input from surrounding populations was limited on the female side. In sharp contrast to this, the paternally inherited Y chromosome shows diversity similar to that of neighboring populations and shows no evidence of founder effects. These sex-specific differences demonstrate an important role for culture in shaping patterns of genetic variation and are likely to have significant epidemiological implications for studies involving these populations.

Similarly, methodologies first developed to study genetic history are being tailored to address medical challenges, including mapping genes that influence diseases and variable drug reactions. In this paper we do not attempt a comprehensive review of human genetic history. Rather we briefly outline some of the complications and challenges in the study of human genetic history, drawing particular attention to new opportunities created by the explosive growth in genetic information and technologies. First we discuss the complexity of human migration and demographic history, taking both a genetic and archaeological perspective. Then we show how these apparently academic issues are becoming increasingly important in medical genetics, focusing on association studies, the common disease/common variant hypothesis, the evaluation of variable drug response, and inferences about gene function from patterns of genetic variation. Finally we describe some of the inferential approaches available for interpreting human genetic variation, focusing both on current limitations and future developments.","apaCitation":"Goldstein, DB, & Chikhi, L.

We compared age-dependent profiles from animals aged under full-nutrient conditions with profiles obtained from animals maintained on a low-calorie medium to determine if caloric restriction slows the aging process. Specific biological functions impacted by caloric restriction were identified using the Gene Ontology annotation. We used the global patterns of expression profiles to test if particular genomic regions contribute differentially to changes in transcript profiles with age and if global disregulation of gene expression occurs during aging. Results: Whole-genome transcript profiles contained a statistically powerful genetic signature of normal aging. Nearly 23% of the genome changed in transcript representation with age. Caloric restriction was accompanied by a slowing of the progression of normal, age-related changes in transcript levels. Many genes, including those associated with stress response and oogenesis, showed age-dependent transcript representation. Caloric restriction resulted in the downregulation of genes primarily involved in cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction. We found no evidence that age-dependent changes in transcription level were confined to genes localized to specific regions of the genome and found no support for widespread disregulation of gene expression with age. Conclusions: Aging is characterized by highly dynamic changes in the expression of many genes, which provides a powerful molecular description of the normal aging process. Caloric restriction extends life span by slowing down the rate of normal aging. Transcription levels of genes from a wide variety of biological functions and processes are impacted by age and dietary conditions.","apaCitation":"Pletcher, SD, Macdonald, SJ, Marguerie, R, Certa, U, Stearns, SC, Goldstein, DB, & Partridge, L.

Similarly, QTL analysis of the Australian cline identified QTL with largest effects on the third chromosome, with smaller effects on the second. However, no QTL were found on the X chromosome. We also compared the coincidence of locations of QTL with the locations of five microsatellite loci previously shown to vary clinally in Australia.

We describe the strengths and weaknesses of these model-based and model-free approaches, as well as difficulties associated with the mutation process that affect both methods. In the case of genealogical inference using microsatellite loci, we use coalescent simulations to show that relatively simple generalizations of the mutation process can greatly increase the accuracy of genealogical inference.

Line-cross analysis of generation means revealed that genetic bases of divergence for both traits were complex and remarkably similar in a number of respects. Strong additive and dominance effects were present in most of the models, whereas epistatic and maternal effects were less common. The presence of epistatic effects in approximately half of the models presented in this study is consistent with line-cross studies of diverged traits in other animals, and does not support the view that epistasis is the predominant means by which populations diverge. In addition, evidence of maternal effects in both traits adds to a growing body of recent evidence that suggests maternal contributions to population differentiation are more widespread than previously thought. This finding undermines the accuracy of studies inferring epistasis directly from the magnitude of F2 breakdown.

The resulting temporal overlap of modern and archaic humans - and the apparent morphological continuity between them - has led to claims of gene flow between Homo sapiens and H. erectus. Much more recently, an agricultural technology from mainland Asia spread into the region, possibly in association with Austronesian languages. Using detailed genealogical study of Y chromosome variation, we show that the majority of current Austronesian speakers trace their paternal heritage to Pleistocene settlers in the region, as opposed to more-recent agricultural immigrants. A fraction of the paternal heritage, however, appears to be associated with more-recent immigrants from northern populations. We also show that the northern Neolithic component is very unevenly dispersed through the region, with a higher contribution in Southeast Asia and a nearly complete absence in Melanesia. Contrary to claims of gene flow (under regional continuity) between H. erectus and H. sapiens, we found no ancestral Y chromosome lineages in a set of 1,209 samples. The finding excludes the possibility that early hominids contributed significantly to the paternal heritage of the region.","apaCitation":"Capelli, C, Wilson, JF, Richards, M, Stumpf, MPH, Gratrix, F, Oppenheimer, S, Underhill, P, Pascali, VL, Ko, TM, & Goldstein, DB.

Moreover, analysis of Bantu and Ashkenazi populations as putative parental populations of the Lemba shows a significant relationship between allele-frequency differentials and the LD observed in the Lemba, which demonstrates that much of the excess LD is due to admixture.

A previous study using Y- chromosome markers suggested both a Bantu and a Semitic contribution to the Lemba gene pool, a suggestion that is not inconsistent with Lemba oral tradition. To provide a more detailed picture of the Lemba paternal genetic heritage, we analyzed 399 Y chromosomes for six microsatellites and six biallelic markers in six populations (Lemba, Bantu, Yemeni-Hadramaut, Yemeni-Sena, Sephardic Jews, and Ashkenazic Jews). The high resolution afforded by the markers shows that Lemba Y chromosomes are clearly divided into Semitic and Bantu clades. Interestingly, one of the Lemba clans carries, at a very high frequency, a particular Y-chromosome type termed the 'Cohen modal haplotype,' which is known to be characteristic of the paternally inherited Jewish priesthood and is thought, more generally, to be a potential signature haplotype of Judaic origin. The Bantu Y-chromosome samples are predominantly (>80%) YAP+ and include a modal haplotype at high frequency. Assuming a rapid expansion of the eastern Bantu, we used variation in microsatellite alleles in YAP+ sY81-G Bantu Y chromosomes to calculate a rough date, 3,000-5,000 years before the present, for the start of their expansion.","apaCitation":"Thomas, MG, Parfitt, T, Weiss, DA, Skorecki, K, Wilson, JF, Roux, ML, Bradman, N, & Goldstein, DB.

Sex comb tooth number exhibited high levels of variation both within and among isofemale lines and showed no evidence for directional selection and, therefore, may not have been involved in the early speciation process.

Available data have been interpreted as indicating that the colonizers of the New World carried a single founder haplotype. However, these early studies have been based on a few, mostly complex polymorphisms of insufficient resolution to determine whether observed diversity stems from admixture or diversity among the colonizers. Because the interpretation of Y chromosomal variation in the New World depends on founding diversity, it is important to develop marker systems with finer resolution. Here we evaluate the hypothesis of a single-founder Y haplotype for Amerinds by using 11 Y- specific markers in five Colombian Amerind populations. Two of these markers (DYS271, DYS287) are reliable indicators of admixture and detected three non- Amerind chromosomes in our sample. Two other markers (DYS199, M19) are single-nucleotide polymorphisms mostly restricted to Native Americans. The relatedness of chromosomes defined by these two markers was evaluated by constructing haplotypes with seven microsatellite loci (DYS388 to 394). The microsatellite backgrounds found on the two haplogroups defined by marker DYS199 demonstrate the existence of at least two Amerind founder haplotypes, one of them (carrying allele DYS199 T) largely restricted to Native Americans. The estimated age and distribution of these haplogroups places them among the founders of the New World.","apaCitation":"Ruiz-Linares, A, OrtÃ­z-Barrientos, D, Figueroa, M, Mesa, N, MÃºnera, JG, Bedoya, G, VÃ©lez, ID, GarcÃ­a, LF, PÃ©rez-Lezaun, A, Bertranpetit, J, Feldman, MW, & Goldstein, DB.

Here, we provide a simple recipe for applying the tests to other data sets and describe the power of the tests as a function of the sample size, number of loci, mutation rate, diploid population size N0, and time since expansion. An important property of the tests is that as long as the population doubles at least once every 0.1N0 generations, where N0 now represents the pre-expansion population size, and the overall factor of expansion is sufficiently large, the signal of growth will be nearly identical to one generated by a sudden and massive expansion. This greatly simplifies the mathematical modeling necessary to evaluate the test results but also means that many patterns of growth will be indistinguishable using the tests. A second conclusion from our analysis is that the tests show different sensitivities to specific deviations from the biological and demographic models.

By analyzing genetic variation in various aboriginal populations from throughout the world, we show highly significant evidence for a major human population expansion in Africa, but no evidence of expansion outside of Africa. The inferred African expansion is estimated to have occurred between 49,000 and 640,000 years ago, certainly before the Neolithic expansions, and probably before the splitting of African and non-African populations. In showing a significant difference between African and non-African populations, our analysis supports the unique role of Africa in human evolutionary history, as has been suggested by most other genetic work. In addition, the missing signal in non-African populations may be the result of a population bottleneck associated with the emergence of these populations from Africa, as postulated in the 'Out of Africa' model of modern human origins.","apaCitation":"Reich, DE, & Goldstein, DB.

In order to evaluate the feasibility of these suggestions it is necessary to know something about how levels of variation at microsatellite loci are expected to fluctuate due simply to stochasticity in the processes of mutation and inheritance (genetic sampling). Here we use recently derived properties of the stepwise mutation model to place confidence intervals around the variance in repeat score that is expected at mutation-drift equilibrium and outline a statistical test for whether an observed value differs significantly from expectation. We also develop confidence intervals for the time course of the buildup of variation following a complete elimination of variation, such as might be caused by a selective sweep or an extreme population bottleneck. We apply these methods to the variation observed at human Y-specific microsatellites. Although a number of authors have suggested the possibility of a very recent sweep, our analyses suggest that a sweep or extreme bottleneck is unlikely to have occurred anytime during the last approximately 74,000 years. To generate this result we use a recently estimated mutation rate for microsatellite loci of 5.6 X 10 -4 along with the variation observed at autosomal microsatellite loci to estimate the human effective population size. This estimate is 18,000, implying an effective number of 4.5(X) Y chromosomes. One important general conclusion to emerge from this study is that in order to reject mutation drift equilibrium at a set of linked microsatellite loci it is necessary to have an unreasonably large number of loci unless the observed variance is far below that expected at mutation-drift equilibrium.","apaCitation":"Goldstein, DB, Zhivotovsky, LA, Nayar, K, Linares, AR, Cavalli-Sforza, LL, & Feldman, MW.

The new distance is independent of population size and therefore allows direct estimation of divergence times if the mutation rate is known.

His theory assumes large but structured populations, in which mating is spatially local. If gene flow is sufficiently low, and the subpopulations (demes) are small enough, they will be subject to genetic drift. Distant demes drift independently, allowing many independent searches of the adaptive surface to take place. A deme that has shifted to a higher peak can, by emigration, cause the rest of the demes to shift to the higher peak. The probability of this shift depends on the migration rate. Previous studies have concluded that very little migration is necessary to effect the shift in adaptive peaks that characterizes the last phase of Wright's Shifting Balance Process (SBP). Here we present the results of a computer study that investigates the roles of dispersal distance, the degree of epistasis in the fitness surface, and recombination on the shifting balance process. In particular, we measure their effect on the population's mean fitness. We show that over a range of dispersal distances the advantage of the SBP is a monotonically increasing function of the amount of epistasis. Our results show that the extent of dispersal that results in the greatest effect of the SBP in increasing mean fitness depends on the extent of epistasis. Finally, for low levels of epistasis, higher recombination performs better, while for intermediate levels, lower recombination results in a greater advantage of the SBP.","apaCitation":"Bergman, A, Goldstein, DB, Holsinger, KE, & Feldman, MW.

Unlike the proportion of different sites, the expected number of substitutions that would have occurred grows linearly with time and therefore has had great appeal as an evolutionary distance. Recently, however, a number of authors have tried to develop improved statistical approaches for generating and evaluating evolutionary distances (Schoniger and von Haeseler 1993; Goldstein and Pollock 1994; Tajima and Takezaki 1994). These studies clearly show that the estimated number of nucleotide substitutions is generally not the best estimator for use in reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships. The reason for this is that there is often a large error associated with the estimation of this number. Therefore, even though its expectation is correct (i.e., on average the expected number of substitutions is proportional to time-but see Tajima 1993), it is not expected to be as useful as estimators designed to have a lower variance.","apaCitation":"Pollock, DD, & Goldstein, DB.

Isolation by distance alone has only a slight effect on the variation maintained in the total population for neutral alleles. The combined effect of isolation by distance and genetic redundancy, however, allows maintenance of substantial variation despite strong stabilizing selection. Isolation by distance allows mutation and drift to operate independently in different parts of the population. Because of their independent evolutionary histories, different parts of the population independently draw from the available set of redundant genotypes. Because the genotypes are redundant, selection does not discriminate among them, and they will persist until eliminated by drift. The population as a whole maintains many distinct genotypes. This process allows mutation to maintain high levels of variation, even under strong stabilizing selection, and over a moderate range of dispersal patterns the amount of variation maintained in the entire population is independent of both the strength of selection and the variance of the dispersal distance.

Using analytical methods, we confirm that this masking hypothesis is essentially correct under free recombination: as long as the heterozygous expression of deleterious alleles is sufficiently masked by the wild-type allele, diploidy is favored over haploidy.

In other eukaryotic species, however, the haploid phase may dominate or the phases may be equally developed. Even though an alternation between haploid and diploid forms is fundamental to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, relatively little is known about the evolutionary forces that influence the dominance of haploidy or diploidy. An obvious genetic factor that might result in selection for a dominant diploid phase is heterozygote advantage, since only the diploid phase can be heterozygous. In this paper, I analyze a model designed to determine whether heterozygote advantage could lead to the evolution of a dominant diploid phase. The main result is that heterozygote advantage can lead to an increase in the dominance of the diploid phase, but only if the diploid phase is already sufficiently dominant. Because the diploid phase is unlikely to be increased in organisms that are primarily haploid, I conclude that heterozygote advantage is not a sufficient explanation of the dominance of the diploid phase in higher plants and animals.","apaCitation":"Goldstein, DB.

In the second study, the same test was administered to new groups of male and female college students. In this sample, the males had significantly higher SAT math scores. The MRT was administered under standard, timed conditions and under untimed conditions. Both raw and ratio scores were calculated. With SAT math score as the covariate, analyses of covariance indicated that males demonstrated higher performance in the timed, raw-score condition but not in the untimedor in the ratio-score conditions. The theoretical and social policy implications of these studies are discussed. Â© 1990 Psychonomic Society, Inc.","apaCitation":"Goldstein, D, Haldane, D, & Mitchell, C.

The effects of dose, schedule, and chronic administration were studied. In the first phase of the study, a dose range of 0.01-500 MU/m\n                        2 (0.0002-25 mg/m\n                        2) was tested and we found the maximum tolerated dose to be 400 MU/m\n                        2; the dose-limiting toxicity with this preparation was hypotension. In the second phase, three different schedules of administration were tested. There were no significant differences in toxicity between a 20 min, a 4 h, or a 24 h infusion of 60 MU/m\n                        2 (3 mg/m\n                        2). In the third phase, patients received chronic administration of either 1 or 30 MU/m\n                        2. Patients given 30 MU/m\n                        2 twice a week for 4 weeks showed more symptoms - fever, nausea, and orthostasis - than those treated with 1 MU/m\n                        2. No significant changes were seen in natural killer cell activity, antibody-dependent complement cytotoxicity, or monocyte cytotoxicity at any dose. Maximal stimulation of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase occurred at low doses (12 MU/m\n                        2). Depressed bone marrow colony formation for CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM in vivo was noted. No objective antitumor responses were noted. This preparation of recombinant interferon-Î³ can be given in doses as high as 400 MU/m\n                        2. Chronic administration would appear to be limited to 30 MU/m\n                        2. However, lower doses may give maximal biologic responses. These studies provide further information on the biologic effects of a wide dose range and a variety of schedules of recombinant interferon-Î³.","pmid":"2160521","apaCitation":"Laszlo, J, Goldstein, D, Gockerman, J, Hood, L, Huang, AT, Triozzi, P, Sedwick, WD, Koren, H, Ellinwood, EH, & Tso, CY.

These agents have been used primarily for alleviating or attenuating situational anxiety, insomnia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and anticipatory nausea and vomiting. Situational anxiety not corrected by psychosocial support, symptom control, or time may be successfully treated with benzodiazepines. Procedure-related anxiety, for example, that related to bone marrow biopsy, venipuncture, intrathecal therapy, and the insertion of subclavian and femoral catheters, is a serious problem that may be alleviated by the use of benzodiazepines. Insomnia not caused by a depression serious enough to warrant treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant also may be successfully treated with benzodiazepines. Many clinicians have found benzodiazepines to be useful adjuncts to a cancer chemotherapy regimen because of their anxiolytic, sedative, and amnesic properties and also because of their suspected antiemetic properties when these drugs are used in conjunction with known antiemetic agents. The ability of lorazepam to induce antegrade amnesia has proved particularly useful in alleviating anticipatory nausea and vomiting connected with repeated courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Furthermore, since benzodiazepines are relatively safe drugs, their continued and probably expanded uses as cancer therapy adjuncts can be anticipated.","apaCitation":"Triozzi, PL, Goldstein, D, & Laszlo, J.

The responsiveness of NK cells to augmentation by alpha and gamma interferon was also appreciably depressed by HC.

The next step is to determine the goals of our care and specifically the extent to which supportive care is needed to deal with problems. For supportive care to be truly effective, the specific underlying condition producing a complaint must be investigated. It is also important not to underestimate the significance of a symptom such as constipation. Furthermore, nutritional support requires as much planning as, for example, the control of pain. Some problems (eg, nausea, vomiting, pain, and constipation) are best managed with preventive measures; others (eg, anemia, granulocytopenia, and coagulopathies) have very specific indications for intervention. Considerable progress has been made toward understanding the mechanisms of clinical problems such as nausea and vomiting, and a more rational approach to supportive therapy is now possible. However, it is usually not possible to recommend any one intervention for a particular problem: no one intervention is uniformly effective or safe. Aggressive supportive care in elderly cancer patients can improve their ability to tolerate anticancer therapies and, more importantly, provide palliation of distressing symptoms.","apaCitation":"Triozzi, PL, Goldstein, D, & Laszlo, J.
